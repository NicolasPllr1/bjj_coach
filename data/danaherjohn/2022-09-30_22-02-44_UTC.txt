Dual threats: Creating a threat that your opponent respects is a good thing. Once he recognizes the threat he will be more reserved in his approach to you and more reticent in attacking you. Better yet, however, is to create TWO SIMULTANEOUS THREATS IN OPPOSING DIRECTIONS so that as an opponent tries to counter one he exposes himself to the threat of the other. This means that even if the opponent knows and expects the dual threat he will still have a hard time avoiding it since he can only counter one at a time and that counter leads to the second threat. A good example is leg locking and guard passing. The threat of leg locks forces an opponent to play a conservative guard game with shortened legs and feet conservatively positioned for safety - but this makes the task of passing guard easier. If he plays more creatively with his legs he will be harder to pass, but easier to leg lock. This dual threat makes the bottom players game very difficult. The game of Jiu jitsu is full of these dual threats in all the major positions and scenarios. Make sure you have an at least one per major position and your game will improve dramatically
