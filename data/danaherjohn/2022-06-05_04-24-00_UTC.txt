California: When I was in my early twenties I lived briefly with my brother in Huntington Beach California. I loved it then and now at the end of the day at the World Championships we are hanging out back in HB and I still love it now ðŸ¤—ðŸ¤— The famous Pier still looks great - I spent so much time there many years ago and Saturday night here looks much the same as it did thirty five years ago. I always loved the Pacific Coast Highway. California has a real car culture - American muscle cars and European exotics abound here. This place is awesome ðŸ˜œðŸ˜œ
