Resistance: Everything you do in this sport - you will be doing against resistance. Your opponents know what you want to do and they generally know the counters to whatever you are attempting - SO EVERYTHING YOU DO IN THIS SPORT MUST BE DONE IN THE EXPECTATION OF BEING STOPPED ON THE FIRST MOVE. As such you must program yourself to THINK AHEAD TO THE NEXT MOVE and very possibly the third and fourth move. Donâ€™t leave it to the moment and try to figure out a continuation in the heat of battle - HAVE THE NEXT MOVES PLANNED OUT IN ADVANCE based on previous experience. This is how you win in a game where everyone knows all the major moves and counters. Victory will go to the athlete who executes the best and who works around resistance best.
