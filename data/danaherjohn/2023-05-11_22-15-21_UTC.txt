It all starts with one move you have trust in: For every given scenario in Jiu jitsu, bottom mount, bottom half guard, top side control, standing position takedown offense etc etc you can’t really be effective until you develop at least one move that you have strong confidence that you can successfully apply on someone your own size and skill level. One move in which you have real skill and confidence is worth far more than a dozen moves that you don’t believe you can apply against a tough opponent. Finding that first move for all the major scenarios in the game is a big part of your initial progress. Of course as you gain in expertise you’ll need more than one big move, but you’ve got to start somewhere. Which one you choose will be mostly determined by three things, your coaching influences, your body type and your personality. I always suggest to select from the most well known and high percentage techniques of the sport first rather than something exotic or trendy - yiu can always build that into your game later. There are ten thousand moves out there - but you need to start with a small set of trusted moves - at least one per major position/scenario of the sport. Once you find them they become your weapons that you carry into battle every time you step on the mat!
