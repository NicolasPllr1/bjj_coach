Jiu jitsu is an art based on closing distance to either get behind opponents or, if you’re in front of them, getting past their legs. The whole game is based on closing distance - make sure your actions in sparring reflect this essential fact. But when you close distance - don’t be naive and close distance into his legs - that’s where your opponent is most dangerous - close distance towards his back or past his legs and you’ll be winning. Cultivate a mental habit of constantly pressuring forward to close distance in this manner and you’ll be very successful in jiu jitsu, but if you shy back and away, you’ll never be a threat to opponents
