Sydney Australia: Itâ€™s been a great experience coming back to Australia to see my family and catch up with the jiu jitsu scene here. Australian jiu jitsu is rapidly expanding in size, enthusiasm and skill. Australia has always excelled in sports as evidenced by their impressive pound for pound performances in the Olympics and many other high profile sports over many generations so itâ€™s not surprising to see them make great progress in Jiu jitsu. Thank you so much to all the people who came out to see our approach to Jiu jitsu - it was a pleasure to meet you and talk about our game. Australia is as beautiful as ever - here I am In Sydney harbor. Iâ€™ve always had a very fond association with Sydney - it was the first big international city I ever travelled to when I was a youngster leaving New Zealand for the first time. Itâ€™s grown greatly in size and sophistication since those days but still retains its beauty and charm. Now Iâ€™m at Sydney airport waiting for my flight back to the US. Iâ€™m sad to leave this great land and my family, but very excited to get back to training in Texas and see my students as they get ready for big upcoming challenges! Looking for to returning here in the future!! ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º
