Go the extra distance when you pin: Great pinners in Jiu Jitsu always seek more than the basic position - they seek to additionally break their opponents posture and stance by getting opponents arms extended. If you can do this you greatly increase both the pressure of the pin and the chance it can be converted into submission. Next time you get into a solid pin, remind yourself to go further and get your opponents arms extended!!
