Victory at IBJJF World Championships! Luke Griffith of New Wave Jiu jitsu won the Brown Belt division at the world championships today. Luke moved from South Africa  to Austin Texas around seven months ago after losing a match at the European/African ADCC trials. Since then he won the second European ADCC trials, represented at the 2022 ADCC World Championships where he went 0-0 with three time gold medalist Yuri Simoe, won two out of two professional WNO grappling matches, became Pan Am IBJJF Champion and now World Champion! He is a truly amazing student with a prodigious work rate and great determination - well done Luke!! ðŸ¤—ðŸ¤—
