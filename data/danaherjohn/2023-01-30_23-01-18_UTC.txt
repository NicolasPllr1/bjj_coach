Time: There is always a short time before the big event where your physical work is complete and now you have to wait to step up to the challenge. In that time keep your message to yourself simple and clear. Donâ€™t let complexity dull your direction now. Every match has a simple theme running through it - keep your mind on that theme. Victory in any given match up will come from adherence to one or two simple ideas that confer you advantage over your opponent. For example, if you have a speed advantage over him, focus your thoughts on how speed can bring victory. See yourself as initiating action and moving away from threats with your speed. Picture your passing using methods where speed is a factor, such as toreando passes. In bottom position visualize yourself in open guards that allow speed of movement, rather than slower positions such as half guard or closed guard. When the action is close keep your thoughts simple and clear and the path to victory will be shorter and clearer!
