Waiting: There is a time before your match where your preparation is over and now there is nothing but time between you and your opponent. It’s a lonely situation even in a crowded room because you know that soon you’ll be alone on the mat with your opponent. In that time every fear and doubt you have inside you will show itself. Just know this - rest assured that there is  another room close by where your opponent sits. He is equally alone and every fear and doubt that he has is making itself heard inside his head just as yours do inside your head. Your nervousness is not unique to you. Your affliction is his affliction too. Once you realize this it’s always a little easier to go out and get to work
