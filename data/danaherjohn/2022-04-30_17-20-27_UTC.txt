The best all round method of passing guard - pass from half guard: There are many effective ways to pass an opponents guard, but to me, the single best all round method will always be to pass from half guard. Why? Because the vast majority of guard passes end with head control as their final step. This creates a critical weakness within them - the need to transition from control of the hips/torso to the head. Making that transition - the cranial shift - always presents a window of opportunity for a talented opponent to escape back to guard as you attempt to make that final transition. The beauty of half guard passing is that unlike other passing methods, you can control the head BEFORE you pass. This removes the vulnerable cranial shift from the process and makes for total control from beginning to end with no real weak points. Of course you need to know other methods, but make sure you put a heavy emphasis on developing your half guard passing game - no other method is so tactically sound
