Daniel Manasoiu wins again! Straight off his victory at East Coast ADCC Trials where he won gold and a ticket to the world championships, Daniel Manasoiu wasted no time getting back in action. He flew straight to Abu Dhabi to compete in Abu Dhabi Extreme Championship ADXC where grapplers compete in a cage in three three minute rounds - a rather unusual format. Dan defeated Brazilian heavyweight Antonio Assef via uchi mata takedown into heel hook in less than a minute to take a decisive win. Here he is hanging out with my teacher Renzo Gracie who was a guest at the show! Congratulations Dan!
