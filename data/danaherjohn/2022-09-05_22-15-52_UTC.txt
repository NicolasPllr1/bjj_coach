Climbing: The worst scenarios for takedowns in jiu jitsu usually involve getting your head and shoulders getting caught under a skilled opponents body weight. This is always an exhausting and debilitating experience that usually ends with you getting caught in submissions or scored on. Get used to the notion of climbing UP when you make contact with your takedowns rather than falling down and forward. As long as your head is over your hips you’ll be in a position to work up your opponents body and hopefully towards the back - that’s always the optimal situation with regards takedowns for Jiu jitsu
