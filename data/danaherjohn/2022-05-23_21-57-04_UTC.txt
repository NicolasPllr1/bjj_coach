My first all American traffic jam experience! I finally got my driverâ€™s license here in Texas at age 55 after not having driven a car for around 30-35 years while living in NYC.  Learning to drive every day into work has been a fascinating experience - almost got run off the freeway yesterday by someone changing lanes who must have either been totally blind or extremely drunk/high - at least I know that Iâ€™m only the second worst driver in Texas now! ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ Today I had my first real traffic jam with traffic completely stopped for an hour on the freeway ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ I finally got to experience what all of you have had to deal with your whole lives! Damn! Iâ€™m sure itâ€™s much worse in LA or around NYC but even this Austin jam was pretty bad ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ And yes, my windshield definitely needs a cleaning - I should have just got out of my vehicle and cleaned it during the hour we sat there ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ Hopefully there arenâ€™t too many more morning like this! ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ I definitely admire the patience you all have to deal with this every morning in the big cities around the world. Iâ€™m sitting here waiting for the invention of flying cars to alleviate the problem ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ Thank god for automatic transmissions! Going through this with the old stick shifts i learned to drive way back in New Zealand would have sucked! ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ Wish me luck for the commute home at the end of the day! ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚
