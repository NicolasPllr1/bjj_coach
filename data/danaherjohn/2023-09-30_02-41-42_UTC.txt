A remarkable performance! South African stand out Luke Griffith @luke_griffithjj won double goals at the IBJJF Pan American games today in both his weight category and Absolute division brown belt - every match via submission! Itâ€™s difficult enough to win double gold at such a high level event - to do so with a 100% submission rate is truly outstanding! Well done Luke! ğŸ‡¿ğŸ‡¦ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸ğŸ‡¿ğŸ‡¦
