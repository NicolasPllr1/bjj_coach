Committing to your attacks: Sometimes when we attack we do so anticipating failure - this immediately becomes a self fulfilling prophecy. Entering into an attack without sufficient commitment to carry it through to completion is almost always a guarantee of failure. When you go into an attack with the intention of winning with it - go in with the commitment required to win with it. Even if you’re faking an attack to set up another you’ll need sufficient commitment to creat the APPEARANCE that you’re going in to win with that move. If mechanical inefficiency is the most common PHYSICAL reason why moves fail in Jiu jitsu, TIMIDITY is the most common PSYCHOLOGICAL reason for failure. Moves applied with excessive timidity are as apt to fail as moves that lack sound mechanics. That doesn’t mean going crazy in the gym - it just means recognizing what level of force application is required to get the job done and making sure that timidity doesn’t put you below that force requirement. Make your calculation and go!
