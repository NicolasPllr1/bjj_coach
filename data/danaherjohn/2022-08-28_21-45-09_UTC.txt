Easy like a Sunday morning: Not every workout has to be a war. I demand of my students that they aspire to train every day - but I certainly don’t demand that they train HARD every day. Learn to pace your workouts over the course of a week. The more days a week you train and the more times a day, the more you need to switch pace among workouts. If you’re training multiple times a day seven days a week it becomes absolutely essential that you have different speeds and intensities for different workouts or you will burn out quite quickly and increase your risk of injuries. If you train recreationally a few times a week pacing becomes less important, until you start getting older - then it becomes an important element of your training as older athletes typically don’t recover as quickly between workouts as younger athletes. Develop a sense of listening to your body, but balance this with a solid discipline that doesn’t allow you to lapse into laziness and make unjustified excuses to take it easy when you should be working harder. Finding that balance takes time but it’s crucial to your longevity in the sport.
