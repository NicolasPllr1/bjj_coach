Training in Thailand: We landed this morning in Thailand after a long day and night of flying and went to a local Muay Thai gym down the road to work out. Itâ€™s so fascinating to see the atmosphere in these local gyms. They are usually located on tiny backroads with traffic directly outside with open roofs. Space is tiny but talent is deep. The fighters literally live there, sleeping eating and training. In between their own workouts they train regular people but their primary focus is on winning their way to fight in the big local stadiums here in Bangkok. There is a deep culture of professional fighting here that begins in these tiny neighborhood gyms. It was a pleasure to workout next to them and pick up on that dedication and desire for technical proficiency that they exude.
