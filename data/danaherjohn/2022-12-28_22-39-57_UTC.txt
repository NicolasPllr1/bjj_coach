Clarity of purpose: I truly believe that one of the great reasons why classical Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is so successful as a martial art is it’s incredibly simple and clear basic directive. You can explain it to a total neophyte in two minutes and it’ll make intuitive sense to him. In fact it’s so clear that I believe if you took two completely untrained people with no fighting experience of similar size and strength and explained the basic directive of Jiu jitsu to one of them but not the other, the one who had been taught that basic directive would have a considerably higher chance of victory if they fought each other, not because he has gained any skill - he hasn’t - but just because he now has an effective and proven SENSE OF DIRECTION while the other only has his instincts. When one person has a sense of direction and purpose in a crises and the other doesn’t - I’ll put my money on the fellow with a sense of direction and purpose every time. What is this basic directive of Jiu jitsu? It can be stated in a single sentence. WORK YOUR WAY TO THE MOUNTED POSITION OR REAR MOUNTED POSITION AND FINISH YOUR OPPONENT. It doesn’t matter whether it’s grappling or fighting. If you follow that simple directive and have the skills to do it against the resistance of your opponent - you’ll be a very difficult challenge indeed. Remember always that every rule, point allocation, recommendation, technique and tactic of Jiu jitsu Bia just a means to satisfying this basic directive. Never lose sight of its clarity and you’ll always know what to do and how to train and prepare.
