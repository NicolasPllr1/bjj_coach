Following movement: Most of the time when we drill submission moves it’s done in a rather artificial situation where the move is applied and the partner taps. In reality there will be a great deal of resistance and one of the most common forms of resistance is that of rolling/twisting/turning out of the lock. It’s very important then, that you practice applying the lock through 360 degrees of motion to follow the opponents movement while maintaining secure control and then finishing in a completely different position. Getting used to this act of following defensive movement while maintaining the integrity of the lock is a key part of developing realistic submission skills that will work in tough sparring sessions
