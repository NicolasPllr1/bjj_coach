Victory in Denver! Teenage phenom Helena Crevar impressed everyone today at the ADCC Open in Denver Colorado. She won the teenage division and then entered Adult Advanced in her weight category and the adult advanced absolute  division. She won gold in both. Even more impressive - she won every match of the day via submission and in less than half regulation time - an incredible performance from such a young athlete. She trains like a true professional and shows a maturity in the gym and competition far beyond her years.  As always she exhibited the full range of submissions from strangles to arm locks and now her rapidly developing leg lock game. Oliver Taza had a great day winning gold in his weight division as part of his preparation for ADCC 2024 and showing his smooth leg locking skills combined with improved standing skills. Itâ€™s great to see these youngsters going out and getting the experience they need to get to their goals!
