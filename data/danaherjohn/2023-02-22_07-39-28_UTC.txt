Getting work done: Itâ€™s late night here in LA and Giancarlo Bodoni @giancarlobodoni is getting ready for his title match against powerhouse title holder 205 pound WNO champion Pedro Merinho. With him is Aussie grappling icon Kit Dale @kitdaleofficial who very generously comes in every night to help preparation. Its always a great feeling for me to connect with Australians in Jiu jitsu and Kit Dale has a been a great representative for many years so it was a pleasure to work with him!
