Step on the mat with a purpose: Most people step on the mat to train with a sense of “come what may.” They approach with a reactive mind and just follow the action of the session. This is fine for those days you’re a little tired or distracted or just plain out of ideas - but the majority of your training sessions you want to have a proactive mindset where you approach the mat with a plan of what you want to achieve. This gives direction to your training session and almost always results in more work being done, more being learned and a clear idea of what you need to improve on tomorrow. Don’t step on the mat with your body first - lead with your mind prior to the workout and you’ll have a stronger sense of direction
