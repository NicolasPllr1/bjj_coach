One of the great powers of the mount position - asphyxiation: Pins are part of the heart and soul of jiu jitsu. The whole point of jiu jitsu is to attain its two most powerful pins - mount and rear mount - and use the pressure they generate to submit even the toughest opponents. One of the great advantages of the mounted position over all other pins is that it aligns your body in a position where you can attack your opponents BREATHING. This massively increases the amount of pressure you can bring to bear on an opponent - pressure that breaks wills and forces them to make errors they’d normally never make. Here Giancarlo Bodoni @giancarlobodoni shows the kind of severe pressure possible from the mounted position as he wins gold in the finals of the Enigma Grappling show in Austin last night over a very tough opponent who himself submitted all his opponents en route to the finals. Breathing is the single most basic necessity for life - when it’s taken from you you can’t ignore it. This is one of the features of the mounted position that makes it such a powerful weapon in jiu jitsu without striking. Establish the position, attack the ability to breath, and the finishes will come, whether by asphyxiation or submission hold.
