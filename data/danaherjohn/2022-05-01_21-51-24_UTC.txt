Work rate: There are many simultaneous battles going on at any given moment in a jiu jitsu match. One of the most important of all is the battle to control RELATIVE WORK RATE. Both athletes are performing work. The question is - who is performing more mechanical work? Of the two athletes have similar levels of physical conditioning, as time passes, the athlete who is working harder physically will fatigue faster. YOUR JOB IS TO CREATE CONDITIONS WHERE YIUR OPPONENT IS FORCED TO WORK HARDER THAN YOU ARE. If you can do this consistently you will win most of your matches based on this single consideration. The easiest opponent to take down, pass guard, pin and finish are TIRED opponents. They don’t START tired and they don’t get tired easily if they are good. They get tired because you make them work harder than you for extended periods of time. There are many ways to do this but the single best one is to make them CARRY YOUR BODYWEIGHT IN COMPROMISED POSITIONS - in particular to carry your weight on their upper body. The longer you can make them do this, the easier will be the task of finishing them.
