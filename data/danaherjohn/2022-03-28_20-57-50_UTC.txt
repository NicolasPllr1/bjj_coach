Conversion: People ask me all the time what characteristics the best athletes I work with or see exhibit - here’s one that rarely gets mentioned - CONVERSION SKILLS - the ability to take a position with promise and potential to score and convert it into an actual score. It’s a lot like golf - the spectators are wowed by the impressive looking fairway drives and long shots; but in reality it’s the boring action of putting that distinguishes the champions from the guys you’ve never heard of.  Learning to convert positions that have potential - top turtle position or side control for example - into actual scoring positions such as mount and rear mount - is one of the characteristics of the best player. If they have a chance to score, they almost always convert it successfully into points. It’s not the most exciting part of the sport, but it’s one of the most important to become a consistent winner.
