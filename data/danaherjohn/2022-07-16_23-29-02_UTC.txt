When you control the head and shoulders - you control everything: When it’s time to control an opponents movement - and that should be the goal of all us - nothing beats chest to chest or chest to back contact when your past you’re opponents knees and in control of the head and shoulders. If you can get to a position like that on an opponent your own size and skill level, you’ll win that position in the great majority of cases. Get used to parking your head right next to your opponents with at least one arm under his arm and you’ll have him in a bind that he will find very difficult to get out of and very difficult to counter whatever you choose to do. Next time you want to put some heat on a tough opponent either get behind him or over one of his knees and get head to head with an arm under his and you’ll definitely have him under pressure!!
