Push and pull: Everything in Jiu jitsu starts with getting to grips and starting with a push/pull dynamic that off balances an opponent, breaks his stance and creates reaction which you can capitalize upon. In a closely contested match it will usually be the athlete who best uses the fundamental push/pull dynamic at the onset of every sequence who prevails. It seems like such a simple idea, but it takes real discipline to employ it every single time you come to grips and real skill to use it open the doors to attack upon an opponent who has cast iron defense
