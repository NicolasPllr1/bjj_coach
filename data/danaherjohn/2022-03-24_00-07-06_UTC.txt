Two approaches to strangulation: The classic and time honored approach to getting rear strangles in jiu jitsu has always been to establish position and control first and then strangle second. In the vast majority of cases this is definitely the better approach. However, you should not neglect the skill of setting the strangle first and then establishing the positional control as they fight to defend the initial threat of the strangle. Many opponents have strong defensive skills and it may not always be possible to sink a strangle after you get to rear mount. Sometimes you will get better results by immediately sinking your strangle arm in deep in the midst of a scramble, creating a strong threat and distraction that will allow you to then set your position. You will then find yourself with both position and a fully set strangle in place - which very few of your opponents will be able to stop. So yes - in the majority of cases, stick to the classic method - but don’t close your mind to occasionally reversing the usual order of things and attack the strangle first - especially when you’ve already found it difficult to break through with the usual methods.
