Aussies on the loose!! I am always impressed by the degree to which jiu jitsu students devote themselves to the sport. Many travel vast distances to train - none more so than the Aussies who have to traverse thousands of miles to come to Texas and train with us. In class today the Aussies were in force! My first great student Georges St Pierre used to come by bus from Montreal to New York every weekend when he was starting out - these crazy guys went even further and crossed the Pacific Ocean!! I was extremely impressed by the degree to which Jiu jitsu has grown and developed in Australia when I was there recently - Iâ€™m not surprised given the dedication I see with these traveling Aussies! A big hello from to the jiu jitsu players working out under the Southern Cross in Australia and New Zealand - keep up the good work - you guys always punched way above your weight division in every sport - jiu jitsu will be no exception! ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡³ðŸ‡¿
