Happy New Year! 2022 turned out to be quite a year! I hope the next year turns into a great one for you and that you are able to work closer towards your goals in Jiu jitsu! Keep working hard, constantly monitor your progress so that you can continue and improve in the areas that are creating progress and remove the elements that arenâ€™t. Understand always that patience is a true virtue and that no matter how hard you try, you need time to manifest improvement. Have faith that consistent improvement and time create a union that will take you further than anyone thought possible. Wishing you all the best from Austin Texas!!
