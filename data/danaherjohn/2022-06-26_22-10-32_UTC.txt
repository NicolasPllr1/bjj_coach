Make the mount and rear mount your pinning goals: The central focus of jiu jitsu is to get into upper body dominant pins that create an asymmetry between your ability to attack the opponent - which is very high - and his ability to attack you - which is very low. Foremost among the pins are mount and rear mount. They are the highest scoring positions in Jiu jitsu - scoring double what any takedown or guard sweep scores, more than guard passes or any other pin. No other positions put so much physical and tactical pressure on your opponents. You can directly attack their ability to breath in these positions. It’s often tempting when you start out jiu jitsu to be happy just with passing into side control and staying safe there, after all, side control is a very stable position and most beginners find it easier to get to and maintain than mount or rear mount. This will hold back your long term progress. Go the extra distance and get mounted or rear mounted. Don’t worry if your initial attempts result in you losing position a few times. In time you will learn to ride mount positions against even very spirited resistance and you’ll have a a pin that creates devastating pressure, inhibits breathing which creates defensive over reaction that will greatly boost your submissions game
