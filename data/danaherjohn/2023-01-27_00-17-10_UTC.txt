The single most important desiderata with sweeps and takedowns is to begin by BREAKING YOUR OPPONENTS STANCE. If you can do that, you’ll be able to takedown even very athletic people, if you can’t, you’ll not only likely fail but be strongly countered by good opponents. No one is strong or athletic in a broken stance. Break his stance and his balance will soon follow.
