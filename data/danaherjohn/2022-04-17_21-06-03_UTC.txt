The single best instinct you can build in jiu jitsu: Sometimes the action in jiu jitsu can unfold very quickly and it’s not always clear in the time available where we should be going in the midst of the action. That’s when instincts tend to kick in. Some are good, some are bad , but there is one that’s ALWAYS great - THE INSTINCT TO FIND THE BACK IN POSSIBLE SITUATION. The back is the single most dominant position in grappling, the highest scoring and the best for setting up submissions. BUILD AN INSTINCT TO FIND THE BACK FROM EVERYWHERE and you’ll always be headed in the right direction regardless of where you are or where you’re going.
