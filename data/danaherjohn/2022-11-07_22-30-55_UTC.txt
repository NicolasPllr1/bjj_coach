Merging defense and offense: When an opponent attacks with a given move your first responsibility is to stop that move - put your shields up and blunt the attack - but the second you’ve done so - don’t congratulate yourself on your defensive success - get immediately to work on counter offense. One of the most profitable times to attack an opponent is in the immediate aftermath of a failed attack. Why? Because in most cases his posture and stance will be broken and posture and stance are the basis of defense. Take advantage of that window of opportunity and get to work. Strong defense is a wonderful thing, but even better is strong defense as a prelude to offense
