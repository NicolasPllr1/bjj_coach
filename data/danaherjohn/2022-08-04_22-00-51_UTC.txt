When to be fast and when to be slow: Jiu jitsu is a game of variable pace. If you try to sprint the whole time you’ll soon be exhausted. If you move like a sloth the whole time you’ll be late for every engagement and have to constantly fight out of bad positions. So where is the happy medium? WHEN YOU ARE IN CONTROL OF YIUR OPPONENTS MOVEMENT SLOW THE ACTION DOWN; WHEN YOU DO NOT CONTROL YOUR OPPONENTS MOVEMENT SPEED THE ACTION UP. This simple rule will give you a good initial direction with regards pace control next time you’re sparring a tough opponent and worried about keeping a pace that enables you to last the distance
