Strangling from the back with or without collars/lapels: When you’re training or competing in a gi and you’ve done a good job getting behind your opponent and it’s time to end it - I’m sometimes asked - is it ok to strangle with your arms the same way you would in a no gi match and forsake the collars? It’s not wrong to use naked strangles when using a gi, you’ll see it done occasionally even at high levels, but it’s not optimal. Collar strangles by their very nature are inherently more efficient than even the best naked strangles. The collar is the perfect strangle implement. It is like using a purpose designed tool to complete a task rather than an improvised tool - they’ll both do the job, but one does the job much better. Train yourself to use the gi when strangling. It will enable you to incorporate bodyweight and leg strength into your rear strangles - a big advantage over naked strangles. In addition the collar penetrates the opponent’s defensive jaw positioning far better than your forearm ever could. It’s there - it’s better - use it.
