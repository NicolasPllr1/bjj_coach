Mechanical perfection: Chasing perfection in technique is a path to both heaven and hell. The closer you get, the better your performance. It can come at a heavy price however, the desire for perfection can paralyze action when athletes keep waiting for that perfect opportunity for the perfect technique that just never arrives, or hold back from trying a move for fear that it won’t be perfect. Make sure the chase for perfection plays a positive role in your development rather than a negative one. Relentlessly pursue ideal form in drilling and do your best to replicate that sense of perfection in sparring and competition, but temper this with the understanding that it doesn’t need to be perfect - just better than your opponents ability to defend it - so don’t hang back when the time comes - go into the technique with confidence!
