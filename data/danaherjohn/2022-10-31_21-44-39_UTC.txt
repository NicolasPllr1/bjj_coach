Falling in love with a technique: I’m sure you have a favorite pair of shoes, or favorite pair of jeans, definitely a favorite car that you preferred over all the other cars you ever drove. We have our favorites in every aspect of our lives. The more important that aspect is to us, the stronger that love is. Soldiers and hunters rely on a rifle to keep them alive and so they develop a deep connection with their favorite rifle. A musician relies on his instruments to make a living and so he develops a deep connection to his favorite violin, piano or guitar. In Jiu jitsu your technique is everything. The best athletes develop a very deep connection to their favorite techniques. Just like everything else in your live - your favorites will be the ones you always come back to and prefer to use when things get serious. There comes a point where you don’t just USE the technique - you IMMERSE yourself in it - and that’s when the path to mastery begins. Satoshi Ishii is a master of the classic Judo throw tai otoshi - the best I ever saw. He began study as a child, now in his mid thirties he still uses it every day and still learns new insights that enables him to use it in anyone, gi or no gi. He has gotten to a point where he can throw a man easily with one hand, and with so much control that he can determine which part of his opponents body hits the ground first. This is mastery. This is the path you must take to develop the depth required for excellence in Jiu jitsu and indeed, all aspects of life. Don’t just flirt with a technique - fall in love with it
