Reading your opponent: So we often we approach a match with a predetermined idea of what we want to do - there’s nothing wrong with that - but don’t let that make you oblivious to what your opponent is doing. It behooves you to always read your opponent so you gain information of what he is trying to do so that you can first negate and then capitalize on his intentions. The second you put your hands on your opponent you can read his level of physical tension and what direction his body wants to move. USE THIS ABILITY. It’s like a a different form of vision and one that gives you real insight into your opponents game. It’s much easier to beat someone when you know what they want to do. The best scenario is one where you know what YOU want to do and also what your OPPONENT wants to do - when you know both you’ll be very difficult to defeat
