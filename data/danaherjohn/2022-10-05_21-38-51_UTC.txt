Now is when it begins: Takedowns in jiu jitsu look outwardly similar to any other grappling sport, but the manner in which they score is markedly different. Takedowns are scored by the amount of control exhibited AFTER the takedown. If there is no control - they don’t score at all. The criteria of control vary from one rule set to another but most involve the notion of three seconds of control that either keeps at least one of the opponents knees on the floor if he turns prone or hips or a large percentage of his back on the mat for three seconds. Now three seconds doesn’t sound like much, but in a scramble three seconds feels like an eternity. It’s usually rather easy for a trained opponent to prevent you satisfying these criteria by quickly getting back up to turtle position. The direct result of this is that the real scoring usually comes not from the takedown but from the takedown and transitions to rear mount after the takedown as the opponent turns to his knees to prevent the takedown score. Thus takedowns in jiu jitsu are very closely tied to ground skills, in particular getting to rear mount to score (and gain the best submission opportunity in the sport). Thus it is the synthesis of takedown and ground scramble (scrimmaging for points in the aftermath of a takedown attempt) that defines the standing takedown game in jiu jitsu.
