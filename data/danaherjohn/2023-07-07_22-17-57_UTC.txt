You canâ€™t learn all the details in a day. Furthermore, the addition of a single detail is easy enough to learn in theory in less than a minute, but to build it into a skill that you can employ under extreme pressure in live training and competition may take months. So take your time with details. Build them slowly and methodically into your mind first and body second. They really will make a difference to your performance - but not today so much as further out into your tomorrows.
