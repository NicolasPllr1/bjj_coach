Get to your grips and get to work! Everything starts with grip - if you don’t have some form of grip and connection you can do very little. When you go to grip - ENTER WITH A PLAN - don’t just go forward and see what happens. Know the grip you want and know what you want to do with it and you’ll get off to a solid start in most engagements.
