Controlled intensity: One of the toughest tasks for a coach is to get students to regulate their intensity levels to the task at hand. We all have a natural tendency to work harder than we need for every task in jiu jitsu and get tired quickly as a result. The opposite mistake is to play so loose that you never get tired but your technique is so weakly applied that you simply aren’t effective. Somewhere in between there is controlled intensity. Here, you focus on controlling the TIME and LOCATION of intensity. Some tasks require a considerable power output from you - apply that power long enough to complete the task AND NO LONGER. With regards location, don’t tense up your WHOLE BODY if you only need to put tension into your legs to get a task completed. It’s very true that jiu jitsu technique does require considerable strength output at times - don’t let anyone kid you, it’s a physical game - but REGULATE that output so you don’t exhaust yourself. Controlled intensity is the hallmark of good jiu jitsu athletes
