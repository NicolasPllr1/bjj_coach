New Wave juniors on fire - Austin Jiu Jitsu getting strong! Last night the @blackwidowinvitational grappling event was held here in Austin and many very talented local competitors came out to show their skills! There were both super fights and an open weight tournament. @luke_griffithjj @davis_asare @helenajiujitsugirl and @landonelmorebjj came out for New Wave. Davis, Helena and Landon all won via submission and Luke Griffith won the open weight tournament, every match via submission to take the trophy! It was really good to see the developing talent here in Austin. Last year at the world championships the relatively small city of Austin won more ADCC medals than any other city in the world! Itâ€™s great to see the effect this is having on young local athletes as they start their own climb towards their goals!
