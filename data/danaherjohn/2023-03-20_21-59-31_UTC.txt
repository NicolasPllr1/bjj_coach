Prolonging the action: We all tend to think of Jiu jitsu in terms of moves and the execution of a given move, but against skilled resistance your success or failure will be determined not so much by the execution of any given move but rather your ability to seamlessly INTEGRATE moves together so that a tough opponent who counters the first two or three will be overwhelmed by the fourth. The ability to prolong the action by stringing moves together is a sign that you’re gaining real jiu jitsu skill. Don’t execute a move and stop - even as you execute a move be mindful of what comes next and you will soon find that success on the mats finds you more often than before
