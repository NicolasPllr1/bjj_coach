Victory in Austin!! The New Wave team had an outstanding performance here in Austin Texas at the WNO grappling event hosted by @flograppling Teenage phenom @helenajiujitsugirl Helena Crevar won via heel hook vs talented Australian Healy Dayan. Oliver Taza @tazagarami continued his impressive form winning a hard fought match against a rival from a higher weight division who had defeated him twice in the past. In the main event Nicholas Meregali @nicholasmeregali took on the great two time ADCC champion Kaynan Duarte of ATOS. It was truly a clash of titans. We have always considered ATOS our toughest rivals and Kaynan one of the Uber elite grapplers of the world. After a strong early offensive Mr Duarte won the initial exchanges but Mr Meregali came back strong and ultimately took down, passed mounted and finished with a superbly applied kata gatame stranglehold for an epic victory. This was truly one of the most impressive performances of Nicholas Meregaliâ€™s career and showed the incredible progress he has made in no gi Jiu jitsu in a very short time. To do this  against such a great man as Mr Duarte was truly impressive. There were many other great performances tonight with very impressive victories to grappling legends Ffion Davies, Dante Leon, Felipe Pena and Nicky Ryan to round out a truly great night of grappling! I had the pleasure of seeing my sensei Renzo Gracie @renzograciebjj who was in Austin for the show - it was wonderful seeing him again - thank you always Renzo for your guidance over the years and the great start you gave me and all your students. Hope you all enjoyed the show!!
