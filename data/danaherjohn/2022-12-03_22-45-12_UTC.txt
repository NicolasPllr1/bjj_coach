Let the position do the work for you: You’ve fought hard to gain a good position - it’s natural to want to take advantage of it by quickly launching into a submission - but if the submission should fail you will generally lose that position. Don’t just think position to submission. Think about position - pressure - submission. The real value of position is more than just an opportunity to submit an opponent. It’s real value is THE PRESSURE THAT ROBS AN OPPONENT OF THE WILL AND VITALITY REQUIRED TO ESCAPE THE SUBMISSION WHEN YOU CHOOSE TO APPLY IT. Spend some time building pressure and the submissions will be much easier than if you just go as quickly as you can to the next step.
