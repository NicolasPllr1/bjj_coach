Signs of success: In Jiu jitsu you’re always striving for goals - some small, some big. One of the major goals in bottom position grappling is to off balance an opponent as often as possible - the more off balance he is - the easier he is to attack. But what is a simple sign that you’ve succeeded in off balancing him? WHEN YOU FORCE HIS HAND TO THE MAT. Forcing your opponents hand to the mat is one of the very best set ups from bottom guard position. If his hand is one the floor than he definitely won’t even be attempting to pass your guard until he recovers. I addition, the hand on the mat indicates a broken stance and extension - two of the surest signs that a well chosen attack is much more likely to succeed than normal. Once you recognize signs it’s a lot easier to pick your moments to attack!
