Victory in Florida! Nicholas Meregali @nicholasmeregali won double gold today in Orlando at the annual IBJJF Pan Ams event. It was one of the most dominant displays of gi Jiu jitsu since the legendary Roger Gracie performances of 2009-10. He won every match by submission from mount or rear mount save the final of open class which he won by sweeping, passing and mounting his very talented rival. It is incredible to think he did this with less than three weeks preparation after focusing primarily on no gi Jiu jitsu for the last year. His jiu jitsu skills and charisma are unmatched on the gi competition circuit and he showed this weekend that he is continuing to improve. Well done Nicholas Meregali - that was one of the most impressive displays of championship Jiu jitsu I ever saw!
