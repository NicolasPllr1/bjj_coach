Jiu jitsu super stars vs Team Khabib! There is a fascinating grappling competition coming up this weekend in Kazakstan at the @aiga.global grappling show. Teams from Dagestan and China will face off against an elite Jiu jitsu team chosen by ADCC head @mojassim80 His choice of athletes is very impressive! The team features Giancarlo Bodoni and Luke Griffith from New Wave, Izaak Michell, Dante Leon, Cole Abate, Fabricio Andrey, Gabriel Sousa, Zach Kaina and John Hansen! It’s an extraordinary team with tremendous talent in every aspect of Jiu Jitsu and coming from very different gyms with different styles but working as a team against the very impressive Eastern European grappling styles! Match formats are unusual - three five minute rounds where athletes have to win a majority of rounds to win or submission at any time wins outright. Being In Kazakstan it’s being contested at altitude so endurance will be a big part of it! The rules are an interesting blend of ADCC and IBJJF scoring which will benefit the wrestling heavy Eastern European style. This should be very interesting! I like the idea of a Jiu jitsu super team with very different backgrounds coming together in a far off location and a unique rule set against very tough opposition. The event will be shown on @flograppling and should be a great show!
