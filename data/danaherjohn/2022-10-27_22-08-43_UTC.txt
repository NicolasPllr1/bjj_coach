First contact: Every time you start the process of engaging an opponent the ability of both of you to attack each other increases as you get CLOSER and you establish greater and greater GRIPS upon each other.  So distance and grip determine the initial relative danger you pose to each other. As distance gets closer other factors such as angle and level become very important - but distance comes first. As such, your approach must begin with STANCE. Set a stance that doesnâ€™t make you an easy target. With regards GRIP - one sound way to work is to START AT THE EXTREMITIES - the hands. Tie up at the hands to shut down your opponents ability to grip and work from there to your own grips. Thus you begin with nullifying your opponents ability to grip and attack, and then move on to setting up your offense by imposing your own grips on your terms. Learning to be disciplined about this throughout the entire course a match is very important. Many athletes START OUT doing this, but get forgetful as the match progress and get scores on as a result. Making it an ingrained habit takes time, but will make you a much more effective grappler - one who is difficult to score on and whose chances of victory increase as a match goes on rather than decrease.
