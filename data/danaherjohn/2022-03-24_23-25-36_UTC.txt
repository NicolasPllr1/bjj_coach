Counting down: Gordon Ryan, Brazilian super star Nicholas Meregali and talented South African up and comer Luke Griffith weighed in for their matches against very tough opponents tomorrow night here in Dallas, Texas. The main event event between Gordon and Jacob Couch came on very short notice and so will have an X factor to it that should be very interesting. Mr Meregali has begun the journey of taking his world class jiu jitsu into the no gi game so it will be fascinating to watch him in a very new environment. Luke Griffith goes up against a physically powerful champion black belt - but this purple belt phenom from Africa has greatly impressed us with his focus and skill development and is excited to show how far he has come in a short time. Tonight we will work out and then it stage time time tomorrow night ðŸ˜œ
