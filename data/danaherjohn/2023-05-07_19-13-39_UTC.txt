Another impressive win for teenage phenom Helena Crevar @helenajiujitsugirl last night in Houston Texas. Helena defended her 145 pound title and won in less than a minute via kimura - showing once again her shockingly high submission rate in competition. In the last few months she has impressed everyone with the versatility of her submission attacks - almost every type of lower body locks, upper body locks and strangle holds. When you can attack the whole body - itâ€™s very difficult for an opponent to defend!
