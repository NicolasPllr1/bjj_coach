I am very happy to announce the release of my latest instructional video STANDING2GROUND TAKEDOWNS AND STANDING SKILLS FOR JIU JITSU. I go over the essential standing skills that make takedowns possible - stance, motion, contact and gripping and the all important breaking of your opponents balance and stance. Then we go over the best takedowns from neutral standing position. Takedowns and standing position can be very different in jiu jitsu than other grappling arts due to the difference in rule sets and priorities. The major theme presented in this series is that in the long term of jiu jitsu is to make significant progress in one of its traditional weaknesses - the standing position - it must develop its own standing game. The point is not to MIMIC wrestling and judo, but rather to MODIFY, ADAPT and ADD to them until jiu jitsu has it own character suited to its own rule set. I believe the most significant progress in Jiu jitsu in the coming years will be the standing game and even more important - the interface between standing and ground that is the true emphasis in jiu jitsu rather than pure takedowns per se.
