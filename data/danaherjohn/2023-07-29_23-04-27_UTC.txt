Defensive responsibility: In a sport where you and an opponent simultaneously launch attacks on each other it’s crucial that you maintain defensive responsibility at all times. Don’t let this turn you into an overly conservative or timid athlete - you want to carry the spirit of attack into every match. The hardest times to be defensively responsible are Gene you’re mostly focused on attack. Most people can either attack OR defend - but the best athletes merge the two so that they’re defensively aware even as they press their attacks and ready to launch immediately into offense even as they’re fending off an opponents attacks. Anyone can think defensively when they’re defending and anyone can think offensively when they’re attacking - but the best think defensively even when they’re attacking and offensively even as they’re defending
