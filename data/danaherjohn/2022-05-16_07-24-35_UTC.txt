Good things happen when you work outside your opponents elbows: Frontal attacks can work well when youâ€™re bigger or faster than your opponent or have excellent set ups to catch him by surprise, but blasting straight through the front door is tough on someone bigger and stronger or who knows what the set ups to your main attacks are. Everything gets easier when you get an angle outside your opponents elbows and work from the flanks. You suddenly find that you are fighting only half of your opponent instead of all of him; that he has to adjust his position to alleviate his angular disadvantage, leaving him momentarily vulnerable as he shifts. You can greatly increase your effectiveness just by consistently seeking to get outside your opponents elbows prior to attacking. It COSTS very little in energy and resources to do; but it can SAVE you huge amounts of energy and resources when launching and completing your attacks - make it a habit!!
