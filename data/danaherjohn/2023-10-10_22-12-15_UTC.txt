Routine: When most people say that a person lives a life of routine they mean it in a mildly derogatory way to describe a boring person. It’s usually seen a bad way to live one’s life. I have no idea what the best way to live one’s life is - but I can tell you this with great confidence - if you want to build skills that can make you great at some activity - you will need to live a life dominated by routine. Building skills is all about consistency over time. Constant big swings and chaos in your life won’t allow this. You need structure in your life that allows you devote large amounts of time daily to skill acquisition with as few interruptions as possible - that means a life of routine. If your vision of life is bound up with learning skills that make you excel at some activity - you’ll need to live a life of routine long enough to develop those skills. Routine may be a dirty word to some, but it’s the path to greatness to those whose future is bound up with skill acquisition.
