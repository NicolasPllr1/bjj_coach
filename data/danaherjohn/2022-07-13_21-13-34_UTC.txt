Getting ready: Tomorrow night in Austin Texas @flograppling will host the finale to their WHOSE NEXT grappling reality show which featured many outstanding rising talents and colorful characters. Headlining the event is a fascinating rematch between the very talented Pedro Merinho and Gordon Ryan. Last time they met at ADCC 2019 Mr Ryan quickly won via heel hook, but since then Mr Merinho has made a thorough study of the leg lock game and has beaten great leg lockers since then. Pedro has a very dangerous guillotine and excellent takedowns. In the last twelve months he has been winning everything he entered and beaten legends like Cyborg, Craig Jones and Vagner Rocha - this will be a very tough match! Nicholas Meregali will have his second ever no gi match against the very talented Strangle specialist Breylor Grout. Mr Meregali fearlessly stepped in as a replacement for Luke Griffith who had a training injury just days before the event. Giancarlo Bodoni will take on the juggernaut of the West Coast ADCC trials Jay Rodriguez in what should be a spectacular bout of two great developing grapplers. Dan Manasoiu will take on the man who fought and won a legendary three hour match during the reality show - clearly this Mr Overvig is a mentally tough opponent who can overcome great adversity to get the win. Mr Manasoiu will need all of his rapidly expanding technique to prevail against such a physically and mentally strong opponent. Mike Rakeshan will rematch his nemesis Sewer Rat (that is not a typo) after their epic match during the show. Both men have very unorthodox games and are not afraid to take big risks on the mat! The finale also features the two finalists from the show - B Team standout Izaak Mitchell vs 10th Planet champion Kyle Chambers. This should be a great evening of grappling! Get ready for a night of grappling action!!
