The power of the guillotine: There are a great many moves in Jiu jitsu - too many to master in a lifetime. Of all the moves one of the most valuable is a good guillotine. There are many variations, almost all of them are very good. You don’t have to master to master them all, but I do earnestly believe that you should master at least one of them. My reasoning is that the guillotine is one of the few moves that can completely turn a match around in just a matter of seconds. It is like the grappling version of a KO punch. You can be losing a whole match, but if you’ve got a strong guillotine you’ve always got a chance as long as there is time on the clock. Here, Giancarlo Bodoni @giancarlobodoni hits a beautifully applied arm in guillotine late in a match against a strong takedown attempt in a recent tournament that he won. Notice how he begins with his feet in an open guard guard position but transitions to both legs around his opponent to increase the power and effect of the strangle. No other submission is more readily available than the guillotine - top, bottom, standing , ground, offense of defense - the possibility is always there somewhere if you look. If you master the move you can take it from possibility to reality
