The mix of positional and submission skills is best: Positional skills are the working basis of Jiu jitsu, but submissions are the goal. That dichotomy makes many athletes create a game that tends to focus on one to the exclusion of the other - but this is not the way. Only when you can seamlessly go from one to the other will you maximize your jiu jitsu potential. Let POSITIONAL skills create the PRESSURE that create opportunities for SUBMISSION skills and you will have a formidable game that few will be able to stop. Here, Giancarlo Bodoni shows exactly this theme with a fine mix of positional pressure that creates a defensive overreaction in a tough and skilled opponent that sets up an unexpected submission opportunity. Develop your game with this unity between position and submission and youâ€™ll go far.
