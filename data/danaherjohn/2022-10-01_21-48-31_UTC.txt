Distance: Grappling is won and lost at point blank range, but it starts at distance. It involves a constant ebb and flow of closing distance to attack and creating distance to defend. In between is the tactical game of deciding where and when to close distance. This is usually determined by the strategy and tactics of the two athletes. Generally those athletes who favor control leading to submission will press the closing of distance since that is how they win. Generally those who wish to win by a minimal score will seek to limit the closing of distance until the perfect conditions to score are set, then attack to score and then go back to a distance where they can avoid retaliation. Understanding how distance can be your ally and enemy is a big part of your grappling development. Try to develop a sense of distance in your daily training.
