Fight the connection: In order to make a move a move in grappling, an opponent must begin with some form of connection - if you break that connection early on - the rest of the move will be nullified. There are many ways to break connection but in most cases the best place to start is at the end of the lever - the hands and feet. They are usually the primary connectors to the body and if they can make effective contact the move is generally lost. So when you feel danger encroaching - break that connection and then start getting into your counter offense!!
