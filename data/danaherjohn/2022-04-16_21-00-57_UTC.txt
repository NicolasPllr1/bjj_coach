What the f**k are those guys wearing??!!! First training session for @nicholasmeregali in preparation for gi World Championships this morning. Itâ€™s a very impressive sight to watch one of the very best gi athletes of his generation in his element! Nicholas Meregali has the kind of gi game that everyone admires - fast tactical gripping into smooth positional advances finishing with devastating submissions. He has one of the most exciting gi games Iâ€™ve ever seen, full of technical nuance, some beautiful original moves and that unmistakable Brazilian flair for movement and opportunity that characterizes so many of the top athletes from that nation. Now our fingers are all mangled and our ears on fire ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ Time for the no gi training session! ðŸ˜œðŸ˜œ I didnâ€™t have a gi after the move from Puerto Rico, so I had to borrow one from from Nicholas. He gave me a black gi so i look like some dork showing up for his first Ninjitsu class hoping for a free shuriken ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ The transition from one game to another is a fascinating one - but at the end of the day itâ€™s all jiu jitsu - just a different expression and a different set of problems to solve! Canâ€™t wait to see how these sessions play out!
