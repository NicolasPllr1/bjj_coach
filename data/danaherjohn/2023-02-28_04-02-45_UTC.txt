First responsibilities: You have many responsibilities in Jiu jitsu on the path to victory, but it’s important to understand that some take precedence over others. Why? Because until some more fundamental responsibilities have been addressed, you can’t move on to the next. In bottom position your first responsibility is always to ensure that YOU KEEP YOUR LEGS BETWEEN YOU AND YOUR OPPONENT. Only then can you hope to prevail against bigger, stronger opponents from underneath, only then can you make bottom positions prevail against top. Your ability to get your legs between you and your opponent and keep them there long enough to attack successfully is the first responsibility of bottom position. Like any other basic responsibility - don’t lose track of it and make damn sure you satisfy it before you try to move on to anything else. In your training make sure you master this to a sufficient extent before moving off into other skills because none of those other skills will be worth a penny if you can’t first get and then maintain your legs between you and your opponent.
