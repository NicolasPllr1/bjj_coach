Immobilization is one of the great keys to submission success: Finishing a submission hold on a tough moving opponent is never easy. If you can immobilize then prior to and during the execution of the lock or strangle your chances of success rise dramatically. Many of the best immobilizations come from trapping your opponents head and shoulders between your knees. This leads to many upper body submissions. Note that you need only immobilize the relevant parts of the body. So for a juji gatame arm bar you need to immobilize the head and shoulders, for heel hooks the area between his hip and knee. When I say immobilize, understand that you’ll never be able totally an active opponent - you just have to immobilize part of his body long enough to apply the hold, if you can’t immobilize even the relevant part of his body, at least slow it down to a speed where you can create sufficient pressure in the available time to get a submission. Stop him or slow him, if you can’t you’ll need a very quick execution of the lock that tends to lack the kind of control needed to beat the toughest opponents
