If you can feed off your opponents defensive reactions - you’ll never be at a loss for the next move: Resistance to every move you attempt is the norm in combat sports. No one is going to let you get your moves for free. You’ll have to fight against resistance for every move you ever attempt. So plan your game around the next move(s). When you have instant follow ups to the expected resistance you’ll never stop at resistance as most people do - you’ll move on at a rate that will will soon overwhelm your opponent’s ability to keep up - and THAT’S when you consistently win.
