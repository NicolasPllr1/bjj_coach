When it comes to developing your offensive moves in Jiu jitsu more is not better. Whichever you select, you will have to develop them over years through trial and error and experimentation. They, perhaps more than anything else will define who you are as a Jiu jitsu athlete. Remember always that you will be judged not by how many you know, but by how good you are at those you have chosen. Understand that true expertise in a few is far better than mediocrity in many.
