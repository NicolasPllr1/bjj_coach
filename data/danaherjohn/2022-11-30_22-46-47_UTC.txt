What you look for - you will see: In Jiu jitsu as in life, if you have a preset idea of what you want and believe, you will tend to see that in whatever is in front of you. If you believe the back is among the best attacking positions in the sport and one that you seek at all times and at every opportunity - when even the smallest opportunity arises - YOU WILL SEE IT AND ATTACK IT! Have a clear idea of what you want and youâ€™ll always have a clear sense of action when the game gets heated.
