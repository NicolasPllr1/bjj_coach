If it ain’t tight - it ain’t right: When you start learning submissions it can be quite difficult to maintain a tight connection to your opponent as you try to perform the move. Space seems to inevitably develop between you and your drilling partner as you move further into the move. This is even more pronounced when you attempt it in sparring and the whole move often falls apart. This leads you to squeeze harder with your muscles to compensate and now you find yourself quickly getting tired performing large numbers of repetitions. Worse still, that tight musculature prohibits smooth movement and now you can’t even perform the move. The key to finding the tightness required for good submission holds that opponents can’t simply pull out of is MECHANICAL TIGHTNESS rather than MUSCULAR tightness. You want to be fairly loose as you move into the position , but SNAP INTO ISOMETRIC TIGHTNESS WHEN YOU GET THERE. Movement requires looseness and fluidity, locks require immobilizing tension - learning to reconcile these contradictory demands is the key to success with your submissions
