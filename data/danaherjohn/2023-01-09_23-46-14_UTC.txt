The back is truly one of the key grappling positions, but like any good position, it can be made even better by going the extra distance and Trapping your opponents defensive arms - making a good position great. When it comes to pins, don’t settle for just the position itself - get the position AND trap the opponents arms and you’ll convert the pin to a submission much more often!!
