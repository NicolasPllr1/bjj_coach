Countdown: Garry Tonon successfully weighed in for his bout tomorrow night against the very talented Caucasus Russian grappler Shamil Gasanov tomorrow morning local time (evening in the USA). The event features four different combat sports - Muay Thai, Kickboxing, Jiu Jitsu and MMA. All four are represented by the very best. Muay Thai icon Superlek is the main event, Mr Tonon is the co-main event.  Also featured is a jiu jitsu bout between Tammi Musumeci, talented sister of Jiu jitsu phenom Mikey Musumeci against the very dynamic Amanda Alequin - this should be fireworks! I always like these multidisciplinary events - the only minor drawback is that MMA and Jiu jitsu matches will have to be fought in a ring rather than cage which is not optimal, but worth it here given the opportunity to see the very best Muay Thai and kickboxing talent in the homeland of the sport. Hope you all enjoy the show!
