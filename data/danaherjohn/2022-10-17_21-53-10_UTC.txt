Play the long game: We always tend to walk into the trap of thinking we are defined by our achievements of today - we aren’t - ultimately you’ll be judged by your achievements over the course of your career. Once you understand this you can begin to see that your central concern must always be improvement over time. Any failure today can be over turned by great success down the line. Your jiu jitsu may well be lousy now, but that implies nothing about how it will be in five years. Focus on building to the future and be confident that any deficiencies here and now can be reversed with training and adaptation in the future. No one was born good at Jiu jitsu, neither were the best at Jiu jitsu ALWAYS good at Jiu jitsu - they had their time as clumsy beginners just like you. Play the long game. Focus on gaining knowledge and developing skill and one day that will turn you into a very different person on the mat!
