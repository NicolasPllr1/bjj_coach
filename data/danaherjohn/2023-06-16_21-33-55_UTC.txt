As one part of the body gets heavy - another part must get light: Sometimes your opponent will put crushing top pressure on you. From underneath it often feels like his weight is immovable. Be assured however, that as an opponent focuses his weight and pressure in one area it can only be done by sacrificing weight and pressure somewhere else - your job is to find that lighter area and do your work there. Here you can see a situation where as my training partner commits forward to put pressure on my head and shoulders, his legs become light and thus elevation becomes easier. There are many other situations in Jiu jitsu where similar themes can be used. Stay calm under weight and pressure and locate the lighter areas that must inevitably emerge. Once you identify them they will be your escape/attack route
