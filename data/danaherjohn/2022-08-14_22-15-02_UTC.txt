Strangles: There is no question that the most high percentage submission attack in Jiu jitsu is variations of rear strangles. You could make a great career in the sport with no other submission but that. However, it is great importance that you compliment your rear strangles with at least one really good strangle from the front. It doesn’t matter too much which you you choose - Guillotine variations, Darce, anaconda, seated kata gatame or another - they all work well. The dual threat from both directions greatly amplifies the effectiveness of the techniques since as an opponent defends from one he inevitably exposes himself to the other. Make sure you have strong strangles from both front and back, at least one of each that you have total confidence in - you’ll soon become a real force on the mat!
