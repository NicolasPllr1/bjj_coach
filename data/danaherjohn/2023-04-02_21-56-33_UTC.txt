The power of lower body attacks: Outstanding South African New Wave athlete Luke Griffith shows the great power of inverting under an opponent and using the resulting off balancing effect to quickly get himself into attacking position in the recent @grapplefest event In Liverpool England. Learning to attack both upstairs and downstairs makes you so much more effective from bottom position as Mr Griffith shows here - well done!
