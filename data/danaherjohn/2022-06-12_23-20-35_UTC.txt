Heading up to Boston to film another jiu jitsu instructional video - back at Austin airport. It’s starting to get warm here in Texas! Hot days of summer ahead. I always loved the New England summers so I’m looking forward to to seeing the gang up in Boston. Then it’s back to Texas to get ready for some big upcoming shows! Hope you all had a good summers day!
