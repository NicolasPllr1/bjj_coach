Your face tells the story: When you engage in sparring it’s good to stay as relaxed as possible to get the task done - that doesn’t mean you’ll be limp - sometimes the task requires great tension - but most of the time you can be a lot more relaxed than many believe. This relaxed demeanor creates better endurance and better movement quality, both essential to success. The part of your body that manifests tension first is the face. If your face is screwed up with tension then it’s pretty clear the rest of your body will be also. Try to keep your face relaxed and you’ll find it’s easier to keep the rest of you relaxed. If the eyes are the mirrors of the soul, then the face is the mirror of your overall tension level - keep it calm and it has a calming effect on everything else. If you wonder whether you’re too tense while sparring - study your face on film and it will tell you the truth immediately
