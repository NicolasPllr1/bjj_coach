One move - many applications: I would rather a student was familiar with ten variations of one move than ten different moves. Why? Because variants of a move are usually very similar to each other. As a result proficiency in one leads to rapid progress with the others. In addition, each variant provides a solution to an opponents resistance to the previous variant, so that you will have the ability to apply the move against skilled resistance - the single most important element in the successful application of moves in sparring and competition. This will garner far better results than superficial knowledge of many different moves. Get a small number of moves that you can excel in - develop many variations of each to cover the many variables you’ll have to cope with in sparring and you’ll be on a winning path!
