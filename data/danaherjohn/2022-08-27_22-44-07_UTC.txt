In Jiu jitsu and in life - you won’t be measured by how many techniques you know in theory , but rather but how many you are willing to use under stress. If you have a working knowledge of a hundred moves in the comfort of gym sparring, you can probably count on around ten of them being moves you’re willing to employ under great stress in competition or against a very tough opponent in very competitive sparring. Just as you may know one hundred people, but when push comes to shove, only ten of them are real friends who’ll help you when you’re in need, so too with your jiu jitsu - those moves that form the bedrock of your game, moves that you’re willing to use in your toughest and most competitive matches - THOSE are the moves that will define your game. Research them deeply, practice them unceasingly and trust in them completely
