Movement creates space: They say never mistake movement for action - there’s a lot of truth to that - nonetheless there are times in jiu jitsu where movement for the sake of movement can furnish a reward. If you can create movement when you’re in a bad position then that movement will often create space and misalignment - and that can create the conditions you need to escape. Sometimes it can be very hard to employ escapes when an opponent is locked tight to you - movement can create just enough looseness to perform the escape or at least create an action/reaction sequence that will facilitate escape. You don’t want to go crazy and dig yourself deeper into trouble with poorly directed movement, but a judiciously applied roll or turn is often just what you need to loosen things up a little prior to your escape
