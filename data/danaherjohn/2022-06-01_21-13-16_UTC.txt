Seeing it is half the battle: A move is a physical skill, but physical skills don’t tell the whole story of who gets to use the move successfully in a live situation. You can have all the skills in the world, but if you can’t see the opportunity for their application they are of little value. Fortunately, the task of identifying opportunities is pretty easy in most cases. For example it doesn’t take a rocket scientist to figure out the opportunity to use a mount escape move is when you’re mounted. Things get more interesting however, when you start looking at the notion of single move being used in many different areas. Then you have to start FORCING opportunities and seeing possibilities where most people don’t see them at all. There’s an old saying that to a man with a hammer in his hand, everything looks like a nail. So too in jiu jitsu, when you have a very strong move, your mind will see opportunities for its use in damn near any situation. The best overall application of this kind of thinking is TAKING YOUR OPPONENTS BACK. This is truly a valuable and winning skill in jiu jitsu and can done from anywhere if you’re creative enough. When your mind is focused totally on your opponents back you’ll be shocked how often you end up there from chaotic situations seemingly without even trying. Don’t just program your BODY with skills, program your MIND with opportunity and then you’ll become far more effective than with skills alone
