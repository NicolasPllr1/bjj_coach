2022 IBJJF World Championships: I am having a blast here at the Gi World Championships at Long Beach California! The arena is packed with jiu jitsu stars and has a great enthusiastic audience! There have been some amazing matches already - some shocking upsets and surprises - and some dominant displays. Itâ€™s great to be back in California after so long away. Lots more action to come later today and tomorrow! Hope you are all enjoying the show!
