Great night of grappling in Austin! @enigmajiujitsuofficial held another great night of grappling action tonight here in Austin with many of the New Wave and RGA Austin students competing. Among many memorable matches for our team some of the standouts were wins for teenager Landon Elmore @landonelmorebjj who won via heel hook against an equally talented young rival Nathan Gerrard. Another of our talented teenage students Adam DeGraff @andrewdegraffmagic won via heel hook against talented rival Jacob Norton. Abraham La Montagne @abraham_the_mountain took on B teamâ€™s very athletic Sterling Mellman and won via toe hold. In the main events section, young Reese LaFever @reeseis_bjj took on B team standout Bobby Sandhu and won via heel hook. Then Helena Crevar, the outstanding teenage blue belt, took on impressive B team adult brown belt Diana Rooney and won via heel hook. In the co-main event Luke Griffith @luke_griffithjj took on Pat Shahgholi from 10th Planet and won via rear strangle. In the main event Oliver Taza @tazagarami had an epic forty minute war double overtime ADCC match against the very tough and talented 10th Planet athlete Andy Varela - Oliver prevailed showing great skill and heart to win. Great stuff from the whole team and showing how much progress they are making in such a short time. It was great to see so many local people coming out to compete and watch - grappling is really taking off here in Austin! Thank you to Enigma Grappling for giving our students a venue to showcase their growing skills!
