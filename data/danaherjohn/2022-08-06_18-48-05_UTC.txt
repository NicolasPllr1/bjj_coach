Weigh in complete: Gordon Ryan and Felipe Peña both weighed in for the main event tomorrow night. Mr Peña came in at 228 pounds and Mr Ryan at 227. Now all the athletes will engage in a press conference. The undercard alone for this event is better than most main events with Brazilian phenoms Mica Galvao, and both winners of Brazilian trials Fabricio Andrey getting ready for big matches. B team sensation Jay Rodriguez will take on rising star Jacob Couch from Daisy Fresh. Bia Misquita, the great ADCC champion will go against Elizabeth Clay. This is a super event - no question!
