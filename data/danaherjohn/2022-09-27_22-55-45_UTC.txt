When you get ready to step out for the biggest moments of your life - ask yourself one question. HOW DIFFERENT IS THIS REALLY FROM WHAT I DO EVERY DAY? If the answer is, “not very different at all” then step for ward with confidence and do what you do every day in the same manner and ignore the hype and distraction - you’re ready for action!
