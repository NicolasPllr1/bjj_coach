The return of EBI! The event that gave birth to the squad - Eddie Bravo’s EBI is about to return this weekend in El Paso, Texas this weekend. It was EBI that launched the original squad into grappling notoriety back when it was Garry Tonon, Eddie Cummings and Gordon Ryan vs the world! They launched the modern leg lock revolution and changed the world of grappling. Now it’s back in its original form with a stellar cast of new generation athletes! Favorite will be 10th Planet EBI specialist Kyle Boehm who has never lost an EBI event as a black belt and is a master of the rule set. On the other side of the bracket is B Team standout Nicky Rod, fresh off an outstanding silver medal performance at ADCC 2022. He is renowned for his back attacks and ability to escape from anywhere - attributes that are extremely important in EBI tournaments. Team New Wave will enter Giancarlo Bodoni and Luke Griffith. They are relatively inexperienced in the rule set but have been training very hard and have the benefit of the experience and insights of Garry Tonon and Gordon Ryan - the two most successful EBI competitors of all time. There are many other very talented athletes in the mix including ADCC trials winners and IBJJF champions - it’s going to be real show!!
