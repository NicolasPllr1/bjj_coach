Be ready with both mind and body: When you come out to engage with an opponent there are a thousand possibilities for both of you. You have two modes of defense. The first is mental - this is AWARENESS. If you are mentally aware of dangers BEFORE their onset, defense is always easier. The second is physical - this is your stance. A good stance covers the most likely attack options an opponent has whilst facilitating your own attacks. Weaknesses in stance always make your opponents job easier and your job more difficult. When you go out there - be mentally aware of dangers and physically set in a strong stance that enables you to confront and overcome those dangers and youâ€™ll always a tough opponent for anyone.
