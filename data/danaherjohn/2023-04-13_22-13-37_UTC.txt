If you could only have one…Thankfully Jiu jitsu gives us many fine choices when it comes to submission holds. All the major holds are very effective. They all have their strengths and weaknesses. If you had to choose only one for the rest of your life - make it the rear strangle. It stands above all the others in terms of effectiveness, application under all rules sets, grappling, fighting, self defense - it’s the best in all of them. Nothing is as certain once it’s locked in place. Nothing else creates such an imbalance between the offensive potential of your position versus the vulnerability of your opponents. With most submission holds you can choose whatever you like when it comes to building your arsenal - with the rear strangle it’s not a choice - IT’S A REQUIREMENT. Make sure you study it deeply
