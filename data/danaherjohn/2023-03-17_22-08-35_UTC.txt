Your power is in your hips: When it comes to generating physical power for we humans, the legs and hips should be your focus. Use your hands and arms to CONNECT to your opponent, but let your hips generate the HORSEPOWER. The most obvious use of this principle is in throwing people, since the act of getting hips under an opponentâ€™s hips in order to lift is easy to observe; however, the same idea pervades almost every aspect of the sport - so make sure it pervades every aspect of your game!
