The power of the hips and legs: The human body is generally unimpressive as a combative organism. Compared with the animal kingdom we are weak, slow, encased in soft, easily perforated skin, devoid of weapons such as talons, claws, fangs, susceptible to injury and infection. One part of our physiology that does garner some respectable potential power however, is the hips/legs. When it comes to building your jiu jitsu game, MAKE YOUR LEGS AND HIPS THE BASIS OF YOUR POWER. Let your hands and arms being a CONNECTION to an opponent, but create POWER through the use of your legs and hips. If you Try to make your power come from your arms you’ll never beat anyone bigger and stronger than yourself and you’ll never be able to engage for long periods of time.
