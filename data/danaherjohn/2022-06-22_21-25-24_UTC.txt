Damn Austin - you scary! Austin Texas may not be one of Americaâ€™s biggest cities, but in less than a year it has become a jiu jitsu powerhouse as evidenced by the roster call for the upcoming ADCC World Championships with a staggering number of competitors coming out of this city. New Wave has Gordon Ryan, Garry Tonon, Nicholas Meregali, Giancarlo Bodoni, Luke Griffith, Daniel Manasoiu and Oliver Taza all confirmed. B Team has Craig Jones, Nicky Ryan, Nick Rodriguez, Jay Rodriguez, Ethan Crelinsten, Izaak Mitchell all confirmed. Six blades has ADCC legend Xande Ribiero and heavyweight juggernaut Victor Hugo confirmed. Fight Factory has William Tackett confirmed. This means a staggeringly high percentage of the total competitors will come from this small city in Texas that previously never figured in jiu jitsu discussions at all. Well done Austin! I have always believed that a small group of motivated people who build a culture of continual improvement over time can create results out of all proportion to their numbers - this town is proof of it!
