On the road to Houston: Driving in to Houston for the big WNO show tomorrow night featuring Gordon Ryan vs Brazilian powerhouse Patrick Gaudio - one of the few men to give Gordon a very tough match in the past. Just got informed they weighed in within a few pounds of each other - sounds like itâ€™s going to be another battle! There is also some excellent tour ya room at welterweight and lightweight along with some very interesting female match ups - looking forward to this show and seeing downtown Houston again!
