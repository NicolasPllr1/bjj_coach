Counting down: We had a great workout at UFC Apex center tonight in Las Vegas in preparation for Thursday night UFC Grappling Invitational. @nicholasmeregali @jiujitsugiant @helenajiujitsugirl  were joined by Gordon Ryan who is starting a long road back to health now. We were joined by the prodigious wrestling talent @romanbravoyoung who is also competing and my great friend and student @bzglick Mr Young used to train with us sporadically back in the blue basement so it was a pleasure to see him again. With him came UFC legend @dominickcruz - watching those two workout was something special! Tomorrow is weigh in day and then the big show Thursday evening!
