Tape: If there is one ritual that all grapplers perform and understand it is wrapping up small scale injuries with athletic tape. Athletic tape plays a similar role in the life of grapplers as duct tape does for blue collar workers - itâ€™s a quick fix for pretty much every problem! When itâ€™s competition time and everyoneâ€™s body is sore every day and every session seems to create a new issue, jammed fingers, skin abrasions, twisted ankles and wrists - the pain is bothersome but not enough to stop you - thatâ€™s when the tape comes out ðŸ˜œðŸ˜œ If there is one thing I encourage you all to carry with you at all times itâ€™s athletic tape. It has done more to keep grapplers on the mats than all the physical therapists, acupuncturists, mobility trainers and other rehabilitation experts combined ðŸ˜œðŸ˜œðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ Make sure your study the basics of taping and wrapping your small joints up so you can stay active. Like anything there is a skill to it. Learn the different ways to wrap fingers,
Toes, wrists and ankles, cover a skin abrasion. Itâ€™s not difficult to learn and is a skill youâ€™ll be using often and as long as youâ€™re doing jiu jitsu
