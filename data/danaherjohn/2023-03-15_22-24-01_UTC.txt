The basis of an opponents defense is his stance - if you can consistently break his stance you can defeat him with your choice of techniques - if you can’t, it will feel like attacking a castle wall. Study stance - how to maintain it, change from one stance to another as the situation demands, and break the opponent’s stance and the rest of Jiu Jitsu becomes much easier
