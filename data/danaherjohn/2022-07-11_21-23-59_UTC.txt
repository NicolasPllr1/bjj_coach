Closing distance: Most jiu jitsu students have a tendency to think the action starts when you get a grip on your opponent and doesn’t get serious until you have close connection. It is very important that you understand that the action begins BEFORE you make contact in the action of CLOSING DISTANCE that makes contact possible. Even as you approach your opponent you must change your demeanor to one of preparation for action. You must enter your stance, move with appropriate footwork, and seek to initiate contact in ways that confer advantage to you rather than the opponent. The action begins as you approach each other, not after you’ve gripped each other. Stance , motion and positioning for advantageous contact and connection are the key themes - and the battle starts earlier than many believe, whether it be in standing position or on the ground - like all things in life, so too in jiu jitsu - start your preparation earlier and you’ll have less work to do later!
