Getting the band back together: Hanging out with old partners in crime Rory MacDonald and Firas Zahabi at the PFL weigh in in Dallas Texas. Mr MacDonald successfully made 170 pounds for his bout tomorrow night against the very tough Brett Cooper. It’s been awesome talking about old times and getting ready for new ones. Now it’s time to recharge and strategize with the best in the business!
