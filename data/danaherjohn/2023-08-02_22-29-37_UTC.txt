Itâ€™s been a pleasure hosting the very talented Jacob Couch @thehillbillyhammer who has been training with us the last two weeks in preparation for the upcoming Arizona ADCC Open this weekend. Everyone knows how good this fellow is at Jiu jitsu - we learned this week heâ€™s also a great character and one of the funniest people to have in the room. My favorite story was when he convinced the people at @flograppling that as a hillbilly he is unable to read or write and therefore couldnâ€™t sign a contract - I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s better - the fact that he said it or the fact that they believed it! ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ It was great having him here - now the competition is getting close so everyone will be heading to Arizona for what should be another great ADCC event with over a thousand competitors signed up!
