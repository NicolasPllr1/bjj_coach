The theoretical basis of the submission game in Jiu jitsu can be stated in a single sentence. USE A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF YOUR BODY AGAINST A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF YOUR OPPONENTS BODY TO CONTROL MOVEMENT AND EMPLOY LEVERAGE AGAINST A VULNERABLE POINT SUCH AS A JOINT OR ARTERY THAT WOULD RESULT IN INCAPACITATION OR SUBMISSION. This is everything we do.
