Once a move is properly set - NOW it’s time to use your strength! People often talk about jiu jitsu as a sport where the application of strength is irrelevant or even bad. This is not realistic. Strength plays a big role in the outcomes of any match where the skill level of the athletes is near parity. What is true is this. Strength applied from bad tactical positions is irrelevant or bad. Strength applied wastefully is bad - but strength applied to finish a move that has been well set is good and greatly increases the chance of success. So if you feel you’ve done a good job of locking a move on tight with good efficient mechanics and sound positioning - don’t hold back - use whatever strength you have to seal the deal!
