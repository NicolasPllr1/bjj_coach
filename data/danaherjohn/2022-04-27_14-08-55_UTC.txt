Gentlemen: There is an odd gentleman’s agreement in jiu jitsu that there is a top player who passes guard and a bottom player who works from guard to sweep or submit his opponent. Typically the bottom player stays on bottom until he either sweeps or submits the other fellow. THERE IS NOTHING IN THE RULE BOOK THAT SAYS IF YOU START ON BOTTOM UIU HAVE TO STAY ON BOTTOM. You add a whole new dimension to your bottom game when you constantly threaten to rise up from bottom and threaten takedowns and hip heists to top position. Ironically this will force your opponent to close distance and pass with more pressure - which makes it easier to apply a conventional submissions and sweep guard game. Next time you’re playing from guard - make sure you threaten to come up into takedowns and snaps to front head lock - you’ll be amazed at how it benefits your bottom game
