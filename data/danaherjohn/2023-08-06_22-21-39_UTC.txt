Impressive day in Arizona!! Yesterday in Arizona the ADCC Open event was held with over one thousand competitors showing up for what is fast becoming the most popular no gi competition circuit. The juniors went out in force under the experienced direction of Oliver Taza @tazagarami Big Daniel Manasoiu @jiujitsugiant had another outstanding performance winning double gold yet again as the stand out athlete of the event. He had nine matches and won all but one via submission. Oliver Taza won gold in his division with a superb display of leg locking skill. Hannah Griffith @hxnnah_jade won gold as did teenage phenom Landon Elmore @landonelmorebjj In addition Abraham, Davis Asare,
Trinity Pun and Reese LaFever all won bronze for a performance that won New Wave the best team trophy once again at ADCC Open. I am delighted to see the success of these ADCC Open events as they give developing athletes from across the nation a great venue to ready themselves for the ADCC World Championships - the most most prestigious event in grappling - and to gain very valuable experience in this rule set. Congratulations to everyone who got to the podium!!
