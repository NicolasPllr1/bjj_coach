Continuity: We judge our Jiu jitsu mostly by the quality of our performance of moves - but in truth, the more important factor is the quality of the CONTINUITY BETWEEN OUR MOVES. For one move to work against high level opponents it must be perfect. But if you can string moves together in sequences the pressure of multiple attacks compounds their effect on an opponent and makes a breakthrough much more likely. Once you feel youâ€™ve reached competence in performing a move, immediately start investigating ways to team it up smoothly with others so that you develop a good sense of continuous attack - because that will be the more important thing quality to win tough matches
