Pressure over time is the single surest route to victory: You can win some matches with a brilliant opening sequence, you can win some by surprise, some by tactics, but let me tell you - you’ll win most by PRESSURE OVER TIME. If you can create sufficient physical pressure for sufficient time you’ll exhaust and frustrate an opponent to a degree where his resistance level drops below a certain threshold and moves that wouldn’t have worked ten minutes ago suddenly start working. The higher you go the more this becomes true. Become a student of pressure and the effects of time and you’ll become a consistent winner
