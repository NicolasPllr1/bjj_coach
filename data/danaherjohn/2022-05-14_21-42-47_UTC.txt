Distinguished visitors: We had the honor of training today with the great Satoshi Ishii, Olympic Gold Medalist and All Japan Judo champion. It was very impressive watching a truly elite Judoka work with the modern jiu jitsu style. His Judo pedigree showed today. He has a tremendous inside trip (ouchi gari) and body drop (tai otoshi) and osoto gari. Like every elite Japanese judo player Iâ€™ve seen he has excellent positional ground grappling (ne waza) that even a good jiu jitsu player would be proud of. I always loved watching his judo battles against the two great Japanese Olympic champions Kosei Inoue and Kejii Suzuki back in the day - watching his jiu jitsu battles today were just as good!
