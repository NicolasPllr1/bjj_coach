Students old and new: In Boston filming an upcoming video with trusty friends Placido Santo @placisantos and Brian Glick @bzglick Brian was one of my most talented students over many years in the blue basement in NYC. His jiu jitsu story is one of my favorites. He was so delicate and fragile looking when he first began training over twenty years ago that on two occasions I took him aside and told him I thought it would be wise for him to stop training and find an easier and safer recreation. I have never been so happy to have been proven wrong as he developed a truly deep and impressive game both gi and no gi. Like many of my early students he chose not to compete but always he was in the gym through the MMA era with Georges St Pierre and the grappling era with the early squad all the way through until we left for Puerto Rico. Itâ€™s been a blast reliving old memories and teaching alongside him today. Tomorrow the three of us are back it! Iâ€™m sure youâ€™ve all got your crazy friends at Jiu jitsu class - I think part of the appeal of jiu jitsu is the lunacy of the people around us and the reflection it offers for our own lunacy to be doing such a crazy sport! ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜œðŸ˜‚
