When your opponent knows the same moves you know and also knows the defenses to those moves - the single best way to get them to work is to distract him before the attack with an attack on his balance and stance. It’s very hard to break through well organized defenses, but if you create chaos first by attacking his balance you’ll soon find it’s much easier to breach a disorganized defense.
