If you can break their stance you can attack at will: Everyone wants to attack arms, legs and neck - that’s great, but do yourself a favor - attack their stance first and THEN their limbs. That way you’ll have a much easier time against skilled opponents who would ordinarily stop your attacks. Your opponents defense always begins with stance. If you can take that from them they will have a difficult time stopping the next direction of attack!
