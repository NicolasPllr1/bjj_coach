Warm body - cold heart: When you get ready for action you want your body to get warm, but don’t let your mind get hot with emotion. As your body temperature rises, make sure the heart and mind stay cold and calculating. It’s natural to get mentally excited and passionate as the action gets closer, but just as you solve mathematical puzzles best in a state of mental calm, so too with jiu jitsu puzzles. The difference is that in mathematics your body doesn’t have to do anything so there is no requirement to get it ready for action - in Jiu jitsu there is - so you’ll need to get your temperature rising - just try to keep it from the neck down
