Stop the attack…and then what? Traditional jiu jitsu is an inherently conservative game. Defense before all. There is wisdom in this, particularly when you remember that traditional jiu jitsu bus concerned primarily with self defense against bigger and stronger opponents. However, in modern jiu jitsu you must go beyond the old SATISFICING mindset which directs us simply to defend an opponents move; and instead opt for a MAXIMIZING mindset which asks us to not just defend a move, but also to IMMEDIATELY COUNTER as soon as the defense has topped the initial attack. Most opponents will be extended and out of position immediately after a failed attack so these counters have a very high success rate. Next time you’re under attack, go the extra distance and the second you’ve blunted the opponents attack - ask yourself what your best offensive option is. Your game will take on a whole new dynamic as a result.
