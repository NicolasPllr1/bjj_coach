Counting down in Las Vegas: Putting the final touches on the team preparation here in Vegas today in conjunction with a man who knows what it’s like to compete at the highest levels @georgesstpierre took us to UFC Apex training center. Now it’s time for final stage of weight cut and pre competition formalities and then the big show this weekend. Wishing all the competitors the very best. Only the gods of fate know who will prevail, but given the unprecedented talent level and scale of this years event whoever does stand on top of the podium when the dust settles can truly be said to be the best!
