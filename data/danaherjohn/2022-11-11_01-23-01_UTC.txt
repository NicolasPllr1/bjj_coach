Getting ready for the show! Luke Griffith @luke_griffithjj has been training hard for his match against rising star Haisam Rida tomorrow night in Dallas with @flograppling Mr Rida had an electrifying performance at the recent ADCC with a powerful submission victory over legend Cyborg Abreau that made him a star performer. Both athletes are progressing quickly, both are tall and athletic, both have a dynamic style aimed at submission - this should be a great match! The card has many other great matches. B team standout Damien Anderson takes on the teenage phenom Cole Abate who impressed everyone at ADCC this year as the youngest athlete. Another B team powerhouse Ethan Crelinsten takes on the brilliant Brazilian grappler Fabricio Andrey in what will surely be a great match with both men possessing great skills, speed and strength. Fan favorite Jacob Couch takes on Bruno Matias in the co main main event of the evening leading into the main event - a match between outstanding ADCC silver medalist Brianna St-Marie and Mayssa Bastos - both women have had an outstanding year of competition and both bring a lot of momentum into the match! Hope you all enjoy the show!
