Roger Gracie and Lex Fridman: The great Roger Gracie @rogergracie filmed a podcast here in Austin with Lex Fridman, @lexfridman one of the worlds foremost podcasters. I talked to both of them today and it sounds like a really great interview! Great questioner with a truly outstanding guest in an interview that will provide insight for many years. Lex asked Roger about both technical and psychological aspects of Rogers approach to competitive jiu jitsu - his preference for mounted pins over other control positions and then a fascinating discussion of his legendary second match with arch rival Buchecha and using that as a vehicle to express Rogers thoughts of confidence and focus. They also discuss Rogers disdain for tactics and strategy and the path to technical mastery that defined his career. I canâ€™t wait to see this! Lex is editing now and tells me it will be out in a couple of weeks!! And yes - they also discuss bears vs lions!! I think that question will be asked in every Lex Fridman podcast from now on ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
