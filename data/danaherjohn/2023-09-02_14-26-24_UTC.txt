Victory in Florida! Giancarlo Bodoni had an outstanding performance last night in Fort Meyers, Florida last night in @bluecollarfc professional grappling event. The grappling invitational featured a truly outstanding field of all ADCC athletes so it really was the best athletes scrapping it out for a $25,000 prize. The field of athletes was incredible - there wasnâ€™t a single easy match in the eight man bracket. Roberto Jimenez, Vagner Rocha, Elder Cruz, Roosevelt Sousa, Jay - Rod, Andy Varela are all ADCC trials winners and world championships veterans - at the end of the night it was Giancarlo who battled his way to the win! Another amazing performance from this outstanding athlete!! Now he travels to England for an absolute tournament featuring the best European, American and Brazilian grapplers - Giancarlo showing that he is one of the hardest working athletes in the game as well as one of the most successful!
