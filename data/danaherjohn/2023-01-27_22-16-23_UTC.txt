Angle is everything: It’s hard to make frontal assaults in this game. All your opponents best defenses are directly in front of him. Seek always to get a preliminary angle - it doesn’t have to be a big angle - even small angular change makes a noticeable difference. Angle will often shorten the distance to a target, get you outside their main defenses, or force them to adjust their position in ways that let you catch them on the hop before their stance is reset. Don’t just step in. Step out to an angle first and THEN step in - make this a habit and you’ll be much more successful at much less cost.
