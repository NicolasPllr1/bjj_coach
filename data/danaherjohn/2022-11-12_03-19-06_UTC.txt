Victory in Dallas! Luke Griffith won a beautiful victory over ADCC sensation Haisam Rida in just 24 seconds with a devastating heel hook. It is testimony to Mr Griffiths incredible learning development that in just eight months of training with us and starting with no leg lock game at all - he is now heel hooking one of the top athletes in the game. Great work Luke Griffith! @luke_griffithjj That was a very fine heel hook! Congratulations also to Ethan Crelinsten on the biggest win of his career so far with a great stranglehold win over Brazilian sensation Fabricio Andrey and also to the rising phenom Cole Abate who at 17 years of age already looks like a world beater! Hope you all enjoyed the show!
