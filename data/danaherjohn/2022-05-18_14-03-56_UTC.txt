I am very pleased to announce the release of my latest instructional video  in the NEW WAVE series - SIDE ATTACKS: BUILDING A DEVASTATING SIDE CONTROL SYSTEM. The side pin  and it’s variations is the most stable pin. It offers a wider variety of submissions than any other. As such it is often the preferred option in grappling sports where striking is not allowed or rule sets that don’t award positional points, or hurst regular sparring at the gym where no one is keeping score and submission is everything. I show how my students apply tremendous pressure from side that sets up positional advances and submission holds. When you can play a game that alternates between positional pressure and the constant threat of submission, you will have a side game to be feared. Of all the dominant positions in jiu jitsu, you will probably spend more time in side control than all the others put together - make sure it’s a strength and not a weakness in your game!
