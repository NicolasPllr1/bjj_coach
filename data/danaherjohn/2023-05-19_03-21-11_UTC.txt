Victory in Oklahoma City! We had a great night here in OKC at the WNO Professional Grappling event. Young Davis Asare @davis_asare won his debut professional bout against the outstanding American wrestler Nick Heflin. Mr Heflin also trains Jiu jitsu and merges it very well with outstanding wrestling pedigree. Mr Asare was able to use the threat of his emerging submission skills to get dominant positions and was very nearly able to finish with a strong looking strangle hold, but Mr Heflin showed impressive mental and physical toughness to survive until time expired. Nicholas Meregali took center stage in the main event against the great two division WNO no gi champion Pedro Marinho in a gi match. Mr Marinho showed his explosive speed early and lunged for Mr Meregaliâ€™s back, but Mr Meregali has been working his defense and counter offense skills relentlessly and used these to score top position. From there he made full use of his rapidly developing top pressure game to take mounted position and finish with the only submission he allowed himself to use tonight - the triangle. His level of technical mastery is truly impressive to watch. He really does make the gi as exciting as any no gi event! Thanks so much to the fans of OKC who came out in force tonight to watch a great night of grappling! I hope you all enjoyed the show!!
