The real power of pinning: In jiu jitsu passing guard into a pin is defined by the act of getting completely past your opponents legs and holding at least one hip and shoulder to the floor for a minimum of three seconds. Most people use pins to score. As a result their is little to no relationship between their pins and their submissions. This is disappointing. The real power of pinning comes from the ability to create EXTREME PRESSURE THAT CREATES OPENINGS THAT LEAD TO SUBMISSIONS. You must seek to create pinning pressure that opponents FEAR. When you can make opponents wilt and fatigue over time under your pins then you will have created the incredibly valuable link between pinning and submission and lived up to the central jiu jitsu theme of position being linked to submission. Good pins attack your opponent on several important fronts simultaneously. Posture, alignment and breathing are the three targets you want to focus on. Degrade those three and youâ€™ll degrade resistance overall and make submissions easy.
