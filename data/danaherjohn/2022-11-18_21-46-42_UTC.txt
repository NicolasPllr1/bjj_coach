Just finished filming the third part of STANDING2GROUND series covering upper body takedowns as used so successfully in ADCC 2022 by my students to win matches and medals. As always Placido Santos @placisantos was the outstanding assistant. It’s great seeing the way in which Bernardo Faria and Micheal Zenga at @bjj.fanatics are giving access for everyone to the best athletes in the sport. Now it’s back to Austin to get everyone ready for upcoming challenges!
