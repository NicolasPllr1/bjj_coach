Undermining athleticism: It’s a great thing to possess good athletic traits. They will definitely help you make progress in any sport including jiu jitsu. Much more important in jiu jitsu however, is the ability to UNDERMINE AN OPPONENTS ATHLETICISM. If you can shackle an opponents movement it won’t be long before victory is yours. One of the very best methods is to control both legs. Just as cowboys begin control of a powerful steer by roping its legs, so too, a good grappler seeks to tie up both an opponents legs when it’s time to control him. When you’re confronted by an athletic speedster, look for every opportunity to tie up both his legs and you’ll find his speed and balance are severely impacted in ways that permit control that leads to submission
