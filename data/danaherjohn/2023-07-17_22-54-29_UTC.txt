You can never go wrong in Jiu jitsu is you focus on getting mounted or rear mounted. There’s a thousand different directions you can go at any given time in a match - some are good, some aren’t - but two directions that are always good regardless of context are mount and rear mount. So if your stumped for direction - just focus on those two and you can never go wrong.
