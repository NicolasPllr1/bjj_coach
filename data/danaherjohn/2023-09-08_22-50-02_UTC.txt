The first battle is always inside your own mind: Whenever we are in a critical situation, whether it’s one where we’re are close to losing or close to winning your mind will naturally start to get excited. Excitement can often degenerate into panic in bad situations and tunnel vision in good situations. You always do your best work in a state of relative calm - jiu jitsu is no exception. When you get into a situation that evokes fear or excitement - win the battle to maintain calm inside your head so that you have a better chance to win the battle on the mat!
