If you can isolate a limb, then you can control the limb, and if you can control that limb you can break that limb: Isolate - control - break. This is the pattern of submission grappling. You need to keep your opponents limbs apart from each other - remember that most of an opponents initial defense to a joint lock is to use his other limb to defend the one that is under attack - so isolation is important here. Get used to the idea of taking opponents limb away from the other limb and away from his center of mass and youâ€™ll get the isolation needed to get to your victory
