am very pleased to announce the release of my latest instructional video AGELESS JIU JITSU: WINNING WHEN YOU’RE OLDER OR LESS ATHLETIC: TOP GAME GI This is the last of the series designed to cover top game in the gi for players who feel age or lack of athletic background is a factor in how they play jiu jitsu but want to increase their effectiveness. It gives a roadmap of technique selection and tactics to allow athletes with mobility issues to be highly effective against younger, faster and more mobile opponents. The gi is an incredible tool to bind up and control opponents and used well it can totally alter a mobility asymmetry between two athletes. As always the ideal is control that leads to submission and the submissions selected take advantage of the collars that function like a noose around an opponent’s neck at all times - whoever puts himself in a position to access that noose first is just a step away from victory. If you feel like this can help your game - check it out! On sale today at BJJ Fanatics. Link in my Instagram story and bio
