The better you start, the more likely you’ll finish well: Jiu jitsu is like life itself, the better your starting circumstances, the better the chance that you’ll finish in a good place. It’s important that you raise the probability of success by giving yourself the best possible starting position in every aspect of the game. More than anything else, This means setting yourself in a good stance at the onset of action. It doesn’t matter whether your in a neutral position, a dominant position, an inferior position, attacking with a submission hold or defending a submission hold - starting with a strong stance raises the likelihood of success. Here, I coach the keys to stance in a dreadful position, defending a fully set juji gatame arm bar. More than ever, this is a time when deficiencies in beginning stance and positioning will cost you dearly. Every time you engage an opponent, every time there is a re-set in the action, every time there is a change in position or scenario - THE FIRST CHALLENGE YOU FACE IS TO SET YOUR STANCE APPROPRIATELY. Make sure you condition your mind to operate in these terms when you grapple and you’ll find your effectiveness in both offense and defense increases dramatically
