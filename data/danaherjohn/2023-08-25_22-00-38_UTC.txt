Breathing: One of the most fundamental operations of the human body is breathing. When breathing gets interrupted it will elicit reactions from an opponent in seconds. When you’re behind someone you can attack their breathing directly at the nostrils and mouth by simply cupping them with your hand; and you can attack their breathing indirectly by locking a body triangle tight around the waist in ways that compress the diaphragm. In the intensity of a match where athletes are short on breath at all times, even a small interruption to breathing cycles can be catastrophic. Learning to attack your opponents breathing is thus a big part of creating physical pressure that melts an opponent’s resolve and wins wars of attrition. It can create reactions that open up even the toughest defenses and leads to other, cleaner forms of submission
