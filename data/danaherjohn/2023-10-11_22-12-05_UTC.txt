They say position before submission, but another very important notion is PRESSURE BEFORE SUBMISSION. Pressure doesn’t have to start with the Classic positional pins of Jiu jitsu - it can be applied from any situation where you have more control over your opponent than he has over you - even in neutral positions. Pressure saps your opponents energy as as energy decreases an opponents will to resist decreases in proportion. When the will is broken, that’s when submissions really have their maximum effect.
