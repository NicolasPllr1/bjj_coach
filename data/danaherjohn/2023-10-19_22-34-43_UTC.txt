Once you develop a strong primary move that opponents fear - it’s much easier to develop secondary moves that feed off the defensive over reactions you get in response to the primary moves. How successful you are at applying moves is not just a function of how well you execute them - it’s also heavily affected by show well your opponent responds to them. If they over react to one move, it’ll be a lot easier to breakthrough with a complimentary follow up move. That’s why it’s so important to have at least one move that opponents know and fear. It functions not only as a bludgeon to break through by itself, but even more importantly, as a provocation that creates over reactions that compromise your opponents ability to defend your other attacking moves.
