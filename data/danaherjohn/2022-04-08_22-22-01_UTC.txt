Stance first - action second: Everything in jiu jitsu starts with stance. Before you even establish contact with an opponent you should have your stance set appropriately. For every change in scenario, you’ll have to change to a new stance. STANCE BEFORE EVERYTHING - before contact, before motion, before any given move - there is a stance that makes you efficient and the further you deviate from that ideal stance the less effective and efficient you will be. A huge part of winning in this game is just having the discipline to get into and maintain your stance better than your opponent does. Next time you’re watching a champion at work - don’t just watch his MOVES - watch his diligent attention to maintaining a stance and switching from one stance to another as the scenarios unfold - for it is only THIS which makes those moves possible
