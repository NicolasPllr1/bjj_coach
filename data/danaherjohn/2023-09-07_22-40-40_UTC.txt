Surprise: of all the elements that can make for a successful entry into a move - surprise may be the best. There is a reason why sucker punches are the preferred weapon of street thugs - unexpected blows are always the most devastating. So too with jiu jitsu - if you can achieve a degree of surprise the likelihood of you getting a breakthrough are much greater. There is a problem however - how can you possibly achieve a degree of surprise in a sport where everyone knows all the main moves? Good question - you won’t surprise opponents with your MOVES - you’ll surprise them with the SET UPS. Try always to create an indirect approach to moves where you make an opponent believe you are going for one thing and attack with another. THE BETTER YOUR OPPONENTS DEFENSIVE AWARENESS THE MORE YOU WILL NEED TO ATTACK WITH AN INDIRECT APPROACH. Next time you’re sparring make an effort to perform a pseudo move prior to your real move. Divide your attack into false first movement and a second real movement - this is how you can preserve surprise in a world where most of the options are already known to both parties
