Gravity: We tend to think of gravity as our friend when we are on top and our enemy when we’re on bottom - but if you play things right gravity can be a trusted friend when playing from bottom too. The method is to disturb your opponents balance. If you can do this, gravity will stumble your oops and force him to base out to recover - and that will create a temporary break in stance that enables you to penetrate the toughest defenses and get the breakthrough you seek. If you make gravity your friend only when your on top you’ll miss a thousand opportunities to win - learn to attack your opponents balance and gravity will be your friend wherever you are.
