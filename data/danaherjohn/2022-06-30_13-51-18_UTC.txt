Rory MacDonald makes weight for tomorrow night: Everything ran smoothly for @romac_gorilla in preparation for his bout tomorrow night against the very formidable kick boxing MMA fighter Sadibou Sy in the @pflmma Now itâ€™s rehydration and recharging time! Great to have @timkennedymma and @itsanplusdrew on hand - their vast experience in prefight preparation is always a massive plus (and an incredible source of crazy stories from the early days of MMA ðŸ˜œðŸ˜œ). Great to be in Atlanta, itâ€™s a very impressive looking city - Iâ€™ve heard so much about it over the years - I had many students in New York who lived between the two cities and spoke highly of it - they were right! Now itâ€™s back to our room to get ready for the show!
