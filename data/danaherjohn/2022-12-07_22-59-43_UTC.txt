Make it a little easier for yourself: In Jiu jitsu the basic lines of defense for most scenarios are pretty well known. For example, in standing position your opponents head, hands and elbows/forearms are his initial lines of defense - to get into offensive positions you’ll have to work past them. Every one of the major scenarios has similar initial lines of defense. If you know what they are, you know what you’ll have to get past in order to attack effectively. Once you gain this knowledge and act on it, the game becomes easier. Remember, it not your ability to perform the moves of Jiu jitsu that counts - it’s your ability to perform them AGAINST KNOWLEDGEABLE RESISTANCE that counts. Learn what you have to fight past and you’ll get there much more often!
