It ain’t over until it’s over: There are many times in jiu jitsu when your opponent will get into scoring/submission positions on you. The more layered your defensive abilities the better you will do. The best athletes can be taken all the way into what appears to be hopeless situations and still navigate their way out and get back on the attack. If you can do this it will have a crushing effect on your opponents psyche. There are few feeling in jiu jitsu worse than getting to your best position and being on the cusp of victory and having a skilled opponent finagle his way out and immediately counter attack. The majority of your ability to do this is knowledge/skill, but undeniably some of it is psychological as you have to keep a calm mind under crises situations. You don’t want your first experience of this to occur in competition - make sure you practice it regularly in the gym with partners who can turn the heat down so that you can start without getting crushed and build intensity as your skill rises. If you can prolong scramble long enough you can exhaust opponents physically and break them mentally with their own favorite moves - this is high level Jiu jitsu indeed
