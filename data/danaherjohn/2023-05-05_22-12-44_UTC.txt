Get to the end of the lever: This entire game is a complex web of applied mechanical and biomechanical insights bound within strategy and tactics - and foremost among those mechanical insights will always be lever and fulcrum. When a given move has its basis in the principle of lever and fulcrum - MAKE SURE YOU WORK AT THE END OF THE LEVER - donâ€™t settle for the first grip you get - adjust until you are working with the most leverage possible - it makes a real difference. Here, outstanding teenage phenom Helena Crevar @helenajiujitsugirl does a fine job of getting to the end of the lever and the result? Another great win!
