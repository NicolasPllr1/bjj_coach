Daniel Manasoiu victorious in Ottawa at ADCC Open! Big Dan Manasoiu had a sensational day at the Ottawa ADCC Open today winning double gold - nine matches six submissions - to show how much progress his game has made in recent months. Mr Manasoiu is a heavyweight who moves like a lightweight - I train heavyweights the same way I train lightweights as I believe many people have a tendency to underestimate what big people can do in terms of agility and movement - Mr Manasoiu is a good example of this. Now he heads to California for the next ADCC Open in Costa Mesa next weekend - there are many talented athletes booked for that event so keep your eyes on that one! Well done Daniel!!
