Continuity: One of the great features of most elite Jiu jitsu players games is continuity. It seems that no matter where the action goes - standing, ground, top or bottom - there is no discernible break in their game - they just flow from scenario to scenario without pause. This is crucial to success as it ensures that they can maintain pressure against an opponent for the full duration of a match without interruption. If you have an opponent who knows they can relieve pressure by taking you into a position or scenario where you have noticeably less skill, he will definitely take the match there whenever he needs to take a break from the action and get some active rest. When you have continuity in your game across all the major scenarios this isn’t possible. You don’t need a vast array of moves to exhibit competence across the whole spectrum of scenarios in Jiu jitsu. Initially just a few high percentage moves will get you good results. Start mapping out the areas of your game where you have very limited skills and filling them in until you start to feel continuity across the whole game - you’ll soon feel the benefits in matches!
