Amplitude: There are few things in martial arts more impressive than a well executed high amplitude throw where an opponent is taken up and then down straight to their back with momentum. Most martial arts reward this with a high points score. Jiu jitsu is the exception to the rule. All takedowns in jiu jitsu score the same regardless of amplitude. The smallest trip scores the same as the biggest back arching throw. Interestingly, ADCC is the only major rule set that gives different scores for different takedowns - however, it does not reward amplitude - it rewards POSITION - if you land outside your opponents guard you get an extra score. When it comes to takedowns, Jiu jitsu scores the AFTERMATH of the takedown - where you land and how much control you can exhibit on your opponent post takedown. Once you shift the emphasis from the takedown itself to the aftermath of the takedown, it becomes a very different game.
