Hands: Your hands and feet are your primary connectors to your opponents body. The hands are by themselves weak, but they enable you to connect to an opponent so that you can use the stronger parts of your body to provide the horsepower required to control strong people. In short, no hands, no connection. No connection, no ability to control an opponent. Once you understand this you will see the value of consistently fighting against your opponents hands as you grapple. If you can control his hands you control his primary connectors. If he can’t connect strongly to you, he can’t control you. So get used to monitoring and controlling your opponents hands, especially when you’re in positional trouble. It’s often quite easy and simple to do, and can save you a lot of grief during tough matches.
