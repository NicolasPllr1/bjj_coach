Know thyself: Knowing what you’re good at is a key to victory; knowing what you’re not good at is a key to avoiding defeat. Knowing both is the key to continual progress over time in the training room. Accurately evaluating yourself is not easy - we know ourselves mostly through the words of others rather than self analysis but remember that others are usually either indifferent or have their own agenda when evaluating you. Learn to judge yourself through results rather than words - it’s always more honest.
