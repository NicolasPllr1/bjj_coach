Time to fly: Heading to Oklahoma City for the big WNO show tomorrow headlining Nicholas Meregali vs the WNO no gi champion Pedro Marinho - in a professional gi Jiu jitsu match! I’m excited to see gi Jiu jitsu taking center stage in a professional show - the soul of Jiu jitsu is always control that leads to submission - it doesn’t matter if it’s done in a gi or no gi - as long as you stay true to the soul of the game it’s going to be a hit! Both of the athletes are known for their risk taking, match ending, don’t give a damn submission hunting style - this should be a great match! There are many other great matches on the card -  check it out on @flograppling tomorrow night!
