"Angle, angle and more angle: The single best place to be in combat sports is directly behind your opponent. However, it‚Äôs very difficult to get behind someone with skills since they‚Äôve been taught from the first day never to concede their back. So typically you‚Äôll have to work with ANGLE - where you move away from frontal positions and off line to the side - it‚Äôs not as dramatic and decisive as the back, buts in most cases it‚Äôs more than enough to get good work done or at least create a reaction that‚Äôll enable you to attack successfully. Make a habit of creating angle on opponents - it doesn‚Äôt always have to be a huge angular change, often even a small change in angle can create impressive results. As your opponent tries to re-align himself with you there will be a window of opportunity for you to enter. You‚Äôll find that the game becomes a lot easier when you attack from angle rather than straight through the front door

"Whatever skill level you are today will be 70% a reflection of your training behavior over the previous five years and 30% a reflection of the previous three months. Failure to apply yourself well in either category can have serious ramifications for your performance here and now.

"Jiu Jitsu mindset: A question I am often asked is what are mental aspects of Jiu jitsu that play a role in the outcome of competition? It‚Äôs a fascinating and deep question that deserves a truly involved  discussion, nonetheless we can make a few preliminary points with regards a highly successful athlete whose mindset definitely plays a role in his competitive success - Gordon Ryan. First, let‚Äôs distinguish between two elements of the mental game. The first is TRAINING/LIFESTYLE mentality. The second is STAGE PERFORMANCE mentality. Most people only talk about the mental aspects of going onstage in competition. That‚Äôs certainly important, but the greatest determinant of the outcome of your matches over time by a landslide is your training/lifestyle mentality. This is the mindset you carry every day as you train and progress. This is what determines your skill acquisition over time. Mr Ryan always operates with the spirit of incremental improvement over time via discipline in training schedule, extreme attention to detail in technique, endless experimentation in response to emerging problems in training, refusal to get distracted by other demands on his attention and interestingly, a constant need to initiate and sustain light hearted conflict with opponents/rivals/‚Äúhaters‚Äù as a means to sustain motivation levels over time throughout an exhausting training program. This need to prove haters wrong is a powerful motivational tool that he uses throughout the year to stay focused year round and sustain progress through multi year training cycles. With regards stage performance mentality, his most obvious feature is high levels of self confidence that enable him to perform on stage at a level very close to his gym performance level. Interestingly the focus of his confidence training is never himself, but his technique/tactics. He does not try to build confidence as an attribute in itself, but as a by product of technical training program and the success he has with it in the gym. This creates a strong link between the two main areas of the mental game - the training/lifestyle mindset and the stage mindset.

"The long way home: Back at Changi Airport in Singapore getting ready for the thirty hour journey home. Sorry to say Garry‚Äôs match did not go well last night. His opponent Tye Ruotolo secured a perfect Darce strangle early in the match and won via submission in outstanding fashion. Congratulations to both Ruotolo twins on outstanding debut performances in OneChampionship last night - they both showed very clearly they have arrived at the very highest levels of the sport. Congratulations also to @onechampionship for putting in another outstanding show. It was an honor to be among so many of the very grapplers and Muay Thai fighters last night. OneChampionship has been doing an incredible job of getting the best of the various martial arts disciplines under their banner and giving them an exciting framework to showcase their skills. As they say, your worth is not measured by whether you fall or not, but by how you respond to a fall. There have been some very very interesting matches signed back in the States - the good news is that I‚Äôve got thirty uninterrupted hours to figure out how to get athletes ready for them üòúüòÇ. Looking forward to getting back to Texas and back on the mats to help everyone get ready!

"When the action is is exhausting and your tired and confused - it will be be your acquired HABITS that bring you either victory or defeat. Training is all about building the right habits and eliminating the wrong ones. Pay heed to your daily training because right or wrong - that‚Äôs where your habits are formed
"
"The journey from beginner to expert - physical and psychological development: We all begin as white belts. Our common desire is to gain expertise. In physical terms it‚Äôs easy to identify what changes - it is skill. When we first begin we enter as klutzes who can bare shrimp across the mat, but by the time you‚Äôre a black belt you will spin effortlessly into a beautiful armbar from underneath a tough opponent without a second thought. But what about the psychological angle? What changes most from beginner to expert? Is it confidence? Do we become more confident? Not always. I know quite a few world champions who are nervous wreaks before competition or even before a hard training session. I know others who fervently believe they have inadequate skills despite winning world titles and having great renown as competitors. Is it knowledge? Not always. Some champions have vast amounts of knowledge, but others have a sparse number of moves and no interest in adding more and they are very successful at the highest levels. In my experience the single most dominant psychological trait among experts that emerged as they went from white belt to black is A CALM MIND THAT ENABLES THEM TO PROBLEM SOLVE UNDER STRESS. Almost every champion and Jiu jitsu expert I knew had this characteristic. As white belts we quickly become FRANTIC when sparring begins. Watch any beginners class and the dominant characteristic you‚Äôll see is PANIC LEADING TO ERROR AND EXHAUSTION. when you watch the black belt class you will observe extreme examples calm under stress that enables students to get out of seemingly hopeless situations and recover. Learning to develop that essential MENTAL CALM is every bit as important as developing your physical skills. Indeed, i would go so far as to say that the physical skills will prove to be of rather limited value if they are not accompanied by a mental calm that judiciously guides their use. When training don‚Äôt just pay attention to the physical skills, pay attention to your state of mind.
"
"For every minute you spend on the mat in competition, you‚Äôll spend an hour by yourself waiting in preparation in that last twenty four hours. Make sure your comfortable being alone and make sure whatever inner dialogue you have in that time is taking you in the right directions. You compete in front of a crowd, but you prepare largely alone - learning to be comfortable by yourself in a stressful and unfamiliar environment is a big part of success
"
"The enemy advances, we retreat. The enemy retreats, we pursue: In the ebb and flow of guard play, opponents will sometimes pressure forward and sometimes recede - it‚Äôs is crucial you be able to follow that movement to advantage. So often when opponents move back, we stop moving and wait for them to come back to us. This is a missed opportunity. When they disengage it is the perfect time to surge forward and actively come up from bottom position and take your opponent down. Don‚Äôt think that because you aren‚Äôt a wrestling specialist that this kind of tactic won‚Äôt work for you. It‚Äôs generally much easier to perform many forms of takedown under these circumstances because your opponents stance is usually compromised. Most Jiu jitsu players are very effective dealing with opponents driving forward into their guard - make sure you are equally effective when they pull away in the opposite direction
"
"Joint locks - don‚Äôt be in a hurry to extend the limb: There are two ways to submit an opponent in Jiu jitsu - strangles and joint locks. Overall I believe strangles are the more effective of the two but joint locks are still a truly vital part of the game. You must make a deep study of the skill of attacking the arms and legs of an opponent. Probably the single most common problem I see in developing students who have gotten into a position to joint lock an opponent is AN UNNECESSARY RUSH TO COMPLETION that sacrifices control and allows an opponent to escape. When it comes to joint locks CONTROL BEATS SPEED. There are exceptions to this. There are times when a fast entry and finish can get you a win before an opponent can get into a defensive reaction - but for every time you see this happen you will see twenty cases where too much concern with speed weakens your control and you end up with nothing. Focus on a tight connection to the joint above the joint that you are attacking. If you are attacking the knee - get a good connection to the hip. If your attacking the elbow, get a good connection to the shoulder. Don‚Äôt be afraid to move with your opponent to maintain that connection. When you feel the connection is strong and you can control your opponents movement - THEN go to attack the joint. Victory will go to the athlete who exhibits great control more often than the athlete who exhibits great speed.
"
"Increasing strength, endurance, tenacity and all the other attributes of your body and mind will lead to small performance increases that will increase your chance of success at the highest level; but be aware that whatever performance increases you get from improvement in that direction is minuscule compared with the performance increases of five, six, seven or eightfold that you can derive from increases in technical and tactical nuance. Your triangle for example, can be improved a little by making your legs stronger; but it can be improved massively (and immediately) by shifting your leg positioning by just a few inches - This is where the core of performance increases will always come from

"2022 IBJJF World Championships: I am having a blast here at the Gi World Championships at Long Beach California! The arena is packed with jiu jitsu stars and has a great enthusiastic audience! There have been some amazing matches already - some shocking upsets and surprises - and some dominant displays. It‚Äôs great to be back in California after so long away. Lots more action to come later today and tomorrow! Hope you are all enjoying the show!

"Finding your favorite moves: This game is built around the idea of knowing ENOUGH about MANY moves so that you can anticipate and defend them and knowing a LOT about a FEW moves so that you can beat anyone with them. Selecting those few moves is a deep personal journey that will last as long as you stay in the sport. Everyone has their own path. I‚Äôve seen great champions take widely divergent routes to the top. These best advice I can give you is this. Individuality and self expression is great but don‚Äôt ignore the fact that certain moves outperform most others. Historically high percentage moves that have worked very well for generations across all skill levels and weight divisions should generally be preferred when assessing which moves will become your major weapons. Within the ranks of those high percentage moves there is sufficient variety to let you express your individuality. You can have a few unorthodox features in your game, that‚Äôs fine, but there is a reason why a subset of moves get most of the best results in jiu jitsu - let those moves be your main focus and express your individuality within those to make a great compromise between individual expression and high percentage technique

"For every person who believes you have the ability to get to your goals, there will be a thousand who doubt you - make sure you yourself don‚Äôt become one of those thousand - in a world of doubters stay true to your self belief
"
"Highly effective, but not universally effective: There are some moves in Jiu jitsu that are highly effective but not universally effective. What does this mean? It describes a move that works extremely well for those people whose body type supports the move, but doesn‚Äôt work at all for those people whose body does not support the move. A good example would a body triangle. If you are blessed with relatively long and thin legs and your opponent has a reasonably slim waist, a body triangle is extremely effective as a means of back control that is generally superior to basic hooks. Anyone can use it, should use it. However, a body triangle may well be impossible for students who have short, thick legs or an opponent with a large mid section. In these cases you can‚Äôt even get the move started. So what should we do? Should we focus on universality as the trait of our move selection? Or is it better to learn the most effective moves and just apply them cases by case where applicable? I do think there is a lot to be said for having a universal game, but I‚Äôm also a realist and understand that some moves (such a body triangle) are just so damn good that you‚Äôd be handicapping yourself if you didn‚Äôt use them when you could. Remember, moves don‚Äôt have to work for everyone in order to work for you.
"
"Running Georges and Gordon through their guard retention/counter offense drills: Remember this always - there are ten thousand possible skills from guard - all of them can be effective in their own way - BUT NONE OF THEM WILL BE EFFECTIVE IF YOU CANNOT EXHIBIT THE FIRST AND MOST IMPORTANT SKILL OF ALL GUARD PLAY - THE ABILITY TO HOLD/RETAIN GUARD LONG ENOUGH TO BE EFFECTIVE. Make retention your first skill in building your guard game and you will create a firm foundation upon which you can build the kind of devastating attacking guard game you see my students employ and which you can learn. Guard retention may not be the most exciting guard  skill to learn, but it‚Äôs the most important because it‚Äôs the one that all the other other skills of guard play depend upon.
"
"The power of the hips and legs: The human body is generally unimpressive as a combative organism. Compared with the animal kingdom we are weak, slow, encased in soft, easily perforated skin, devoid of weapons such as talons, claws, fangs, susceptible to injury and infection. One part of our physiology that does garner some respectable potential power however, is the hips/legs. When it comes to building your jiu jitsu game, MAKE YOUR LEGS AND HIPS THE BASIS OF YOUR POWER. Let your hands and arms being a CONNECTION to an opponent, but create POWER through the use of your legs and hips. If you Try to make your power come from your arms you‚Äôll never beat anyone bigger and stronger than yourself and you‚Äôll never be able to engage for long periods of time. Almost all our daily tasks other than locomotion are done with hands and arms. Jiu jitsu demands of you that you do the opposite and make almost all your jiu jitsu tasks be done predominantly with legs and hips. Making this insight the center of your game as early as possible is the key to progress in Jiu jitsu

"Nicholas Meregali ADCC 2022: One of the outstanding performances at this ADCC World Championships was undoubtedly Nicholas Meregali who had one of the best debut performances in memory taking silver and Bronze in his first ADCC. What made this so remarkable is that just six months prior he had never trained without a gi even once in his life! His first ever no gi training was an impromptu session with Gordon Ryan when they were both filming videos in Boston! Mr Meregali decided to move to Austin Texas to begin training. Soon after doing so he said to me one day, ‚ÄúI want to be the first person to win IBJJF Absolute and ADCC Absolute in the same year.‚Äù It seemed a crazy idea for someone who didn‚Äôt know a single takedown and who never had a single no gi match in an age of no gi specialists. I must say however, that I was deeply impressed by Mr Meregali‚Äôs self belief. As you‚Äôd expect,  start was rough and difficult but he never faltered in his training despite initial frustration and disappointment. Then he had to lose two months of no gi training when the IBJJF world championships - despite suffering a severe rib injury three weeks prior to the event he won. Then he had to get back into his ADCC preparation. He took on matches and improved with each one, all while maintaining his training schedule. At ADCC he surprised everyone with his ability to negate strong leg lock specialists and stand comfortably with takedown specialists. He fought far above the level of someone with less than six months of no gi experience and came very very close to reaching his audacious goal of double gold gi and no gi in his rookie year. Mr Meregali is a truly fine example of dream big, but maintain a workload proportional to the size of your dreams so that they become reality. When your dreams are big the hard fight to realize them will make you greater athlete than another with smaller more realistic dreams - even if you come short of them you‚Äôll achieve something remarkable and prepare yourself better for your next goal!
"
"The best of the best: ADCC 2022 is coming up next week. The main event features the great Andre Galvao vs Gordon Ryan in a super fight that could well be described as the bout to determine who is the greatest ADCC athlete of all time. Mr Galvao has amassed a record that far surpasses any other ADCC athlete with regards superfight success. He is one of a handful of athletes who have achieved double gold in ADCC. Gordon Ryan entered ADCC in 2017 with the most successful debut in history and then hit double gold in only his second ADCC event as well as becoming one of a tiny number of athletes who have won gold in different weight divisions. They are both at the top of the game, they have both taken hard fought but dominant forty minute wins over the other great figure of this era, Felipe Pena. Each has a very different style and approach to Jiu jitsu. Mr Galvao is the greatest no gi TACTICIAN of all time, Gordon Ryan is the greatest no gi TECHNICIAN of all time. The history of jiu jitsu shows very clearly that tacticians often defeat technicians and technicians often defeat tacticians - it goes both ways - they can both beat each other, but in very different ways - that‚Äôs what makes this such a compelling match up. Training has been harsh for both men. Mr Ryan had to peak for three different events in this camp, first a super fight with Pedro Marino, then Felipe Pena and now an ADCC where he will do both his weight division AND the super fight - the first man in history to attempt this. No mortal knows what will happen, but one thing we do know is that whoever wins achieves grappling immortality.

"A strange and wonderful thing about this sport is that no matter how bad a position in which you may find yourself, you are never more than two (or at most three) moves away from victory if you can combine escapes with submissions. Let this insight give you confidence and hope in bad positions and make you circumspect and diligent when in good positions
"
"Takedowns for self defense - thoughts on amplitude: A common sentiment you will hear is that one of the chief virtues of takedowns for self defense training is that a hard powerful takedown on concrete is a fight ender and means you don‚Äôt even need to go the ground. There is definitely some truth to this. I have personally seen some fights ended immediately by a hard slam into the ground. The old cliche is that a boxer can only hit with the weight of his hands, but a grappler (with high amplitude takedowns) can hit with the weight of the earth. My experience was that there were mixed results with big slams in street fights. For every time I saw someone incapacitated by a heavy slam, I saw many others get right back and immediately resume fighting. I have also seen situations where a hard throw was performed and the person thrown tightly grabbed the thrower in panic and BOTH protagonists went hard into the cement with the thrower getting hurt as badly as the person thrown. The truth is, the harder the throw, the more difficult it is to control the landing for both of you. Thus hard throws on cement can be something of a double edge sword. If you are going to throw someone hard and use takedowns as a weapon in itself rather than as merely a means to take someone to the ground, then you will want to use techniques that put the OTHER fellow into a hard fall - not BOTH of you. This means you generally ought to favor throwing techniques where you keep both feet on the floor and can retain balance after the throw (for example, Tai otoshi rather than say, uchi mata) Interestingly in the sport of SAMBO they award the highest score to takedowns that do exactly this - throw someone with amplitude but where you remain standing over them. You don‚Äôt see it too often in competition as it‚Äôs difficult to achieve, but it does happen and is a good reflection of the self defense ideal for takedowns. Be realistic however - understand that a hard throw certainly CAN end a fight immediately, but is not guaranteed - as I said earlier, I‚Äôve seen plenty of people get slammed hard and come right back up swinging - be ready to follow up appropriately based on the circumstances.
"
"Make sure you have good strangles from the front and the back: History has shown that strangles from rear mount have been the single most successful and versatile form of submission in Jiu jitsu. All students should do everything in their power to increase their skill in this area. Less well known however, is the idea that one of the best ways to increase your success with rear strangles is to get good at front strangles. Once you establish a reputation as a dangerous strangler from frontal positions, opponents will be forced to go into strong defensive reactions to that threat - reactions so strong and predictable that they make the task of shifting to a position behind an opponent to set up rear strangles much easier than they would otherwise be. DIVERSION will always be one of the best means to break through strong defenses in combat sports - and a good front strangle is an excellent diversion for a quick go behind and entry into your favorite rear strangles. So make sure you can attack well both front and back with strangle attacks, since improvement in one will very naturally lead to increased success with the other (yes, the relationship goes in both directions, though usually front to back is preferable over back to front because it leads to a more controlling position )
"
"Making waves: The talented juniors of New Wave had another great night of local competition tonight here in Austin. @reeseis_bjj Reese LeFever won the lightweight tournament against very talented opponents and won every match by submission in a superb performance that showed his hard work in training has has great effects. @davis_asare continued his incredible weekend of work - he competed three nights in a row in three different events and won every match mostly with highlight reel submissions! It‚Äôs great to see the combination of ambition and hard work working its magic! As always keep your eyes on the distant horizon but your mind on the next practical step and you‚Äôll be amazed at what you can accomplish!!
"
"Glamor vs practicality: Everywhere is life we have to make a choice between an exciting, glamorous option vs a pragmatic, practical option. We have to choose between an exciting fast car versus a safe and reliable one, friends who can get you into fancy nightclubs and introduce you to to excitement and fun versus a friend who always has your back no matter what. Jiu jitsu is the same. There are lots of exciting and fun elements that get our attention and there are some that are extremely important but don‚Äôt get much attention. Probably the two least glamorous skill areas of Jiu jitsu are pin escapes and guard retention. Neither will result in highlight reels, yet your ability to perform all the more exciting aspects of Jiu jitsu is entirely dependent upon your ability to get out of bad pins and/or prevent them happening in the first place. You simply can‚Äôt play an exciting game if you‚Äôre being constantly held down and pinned. Make sure you devote a sufficient time in your training for the less glamorous but absolutely crucial aspects of the sport that may not be exciting in themselves, but which make the exciting aspects possible. Spend time getting out of pins and stopping opponents from passing - if you are starting out in Jiu jitsu I would prioritize these skills above all others

"Rites of passage: Almost all my adult life I lived in NYC so I never bought a car. I always used the subway, trains and cabs to get around. I didn‚Äôt even have a driver‚Äôs license, forget about a car. Now I‚Äôve moved to Texas so I finally had to learn to drive and buy a car - of course when I finally decide to buy a car the American car market goes into total chaos and prices of cars and gasoline skyrocket üòÇüòÇüòÇ All these years my friends would always tell me horror stories of the daily and weekly expenses of their vehicles. In NYC it was smashed windows, paint scratched off by people parking clumsily next to them, broken indicator lights, burst tires and damaged rims from potholes and of course flat tires. I always thought to myself as I heard their stories ‚Äúthank god I don‚Äôt have these problems!‚Äù Well, now I finally do! üòÇüòÇ I got to work teaching today and saw a giant screw sticking out of my rear tire! üòÇüòÇüòÇ I guess I‚Äôm finally living the real American experience! üòÇüòÇüòÇ Off to the tire shop tomorrow to get it plugged or maybe even replaced ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòÇü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èNow  I know what you‚Äôll have been going through all these years! üòÇüòÇ I enjoy driving but it‚Äôs definitely a perk with problems!

"Attacking the whole body: The single most important factor in how effective your attacks will be is their mechanical efficiency. If your attacks are mechanically weak they simply won‚Äôt have sufficient power to have any effect on an opponent. Close behind mechanical considerations however is the notion of DIVERSITY OF ATTACKS. If you attack only one part of the body you become predictable and your opponent will have an easy time anticipating you and putting up strong defenses in the specific area you are focusing your attacks. ONLY WHEN YOU ATTACK THE WHOLE BODY CAN YOU SCATTER YOUR OPPONENTS DEFENSES. Once his attention is pulled into one zone it‚Äôs easy to attack another. You don‚Äôt a vast array of attacks - just enough to have one or two good attacks to lower body, upper body and head/neck. It‚Äôs not so much the NUMBER of attacks you have, as your ability to target the whole body and shift rapidly from one target area to another that will determine your effectiveness. Attacks on the left will always set up attacks on the right, attacks to the upper body will disguise subsequent attacks to the lower body - this the nature of good jiu jitsu and martial arts in general
"
"There aren‚Äôt many moves that you HAVE to know - but a good Guillotine is probably one of them: Jiu jitsu gives you a lot freedom of choice when it comes to move selection. There is a huge variation among the great champions as to what their main moves where. As you get more fundamental the moves become less optional - it‚Äôs hard to imagine a world champion who had no elbow escape for example. Among the submission holds I always encourage my students to develop a strong Guillotine attack. There are few submissions that are as readily available in all aspects of play without a gi than the guillotine. Top or bottom, standing or ground, set position or scramble - it‚Äôs pretty much always available at some point after just a few minutes of action. There are many variations - I favor high wrist variations above all others, but great champions have used many variations with great success so find whichever one works best for you. Because you can easily switch sides with your opponents head you only need to be strong on one side with the guillotine. In my case I have a good arm in guillotine on my left and a good high wrist on my right - so I can play both sides, but with different variations; but at a minimum have a really strong variation on one side and you will be ready to go!
"
"Expressing who you are through Jiu jitsu: Jiu Jitsu offers a veritable ocean of moves to its practitioners. You could live ten lifetimes and not master them all. It‚Äôs important then, that you focus on those which best suit your body type and personality. When you first begin study you need to simply learn the basic moves as best you can, but in time you will begin to notice that certain moves come more natural you than others. By the time you are a black belt your distinctive game will reflect who you are as clearly as your finger prints. Don‚Äôt try to force this process. Don‚Äôt start off with a statement that this or that move will be your favorite - it will happen organically over time as naturally as your features change with age. Though I teach a program that has a distinctive look among all my students - beginning with cast iron defense and submission offense around the whole body with a heavy emphasis on legs and back - I make sure I teach a large number of moves and tactics and leave lots of room for individual experimentation so that within the commonalities of my students there are many different interpretations to suit their individual body types and personalities. In the early stages  the moves of Jiu jitsu must be given out under the control of the teacher, but as you develop over time they must be offered as a smorgasbord that allows the students to pick and  choose those which best suit what they want and need. I always tell my students - i am a dictator on the fundamentals of Jiu jitsu - there is no choice on those, they have to be learned - but I am a libertarian on the rest of the game. As you practice keep a note of those moves that seem to come more naturally to you than others. Research how successful/high percentage they are in top level competition. Perhaps one day they will become the defining feature of your game

"I started my career teaching introductory classes to one or two white belts at a time. Then I built up to small beginner classes with five or six people. In time I averaged over a hundred people per class in the lunch hour with some of the greatest combat athletes in the world. Now I‚Äôve come full circle and I‚Äôm back to teaching tiny classes. I was able to create a sense of progress and development in all cases regardless of class size, location or talent level. Your rate of progress towards your goals has much more to do with what is inside your head than where you are, who is around you or how many people there are. Know what you want - acquire the skills to make it possible - formulate a plan to get there - have the discipline to stay the course and the wisdom to modify the plan in the face of changing circumstances and you can shock the world regardless of where you are and who or how many you are surrounded by.
"
"Head and shoulders: people talk a lot about head control in Jiu jitsu, and for a good reason - because head control is probably the single best means of controlling the overall movement and posture of an opponents body. Understand however, that in the majority of cases in Jiu jitsu, it won‚Äôt just be control of the head that gives you the control you need for victory, but rather control of the head AND shoulders. When you control the HEAD AND SHOULDER GIRDLE then you truly control an opponent. In most cases this is done via an underhook in combination with a cross face, and this is locked in place through the position of your own head. This creates an unholy trinity of pressure - crossface, underhook and head position - that truly enables you to shut down resistance and movement as you play your game. Look at how Gordon Ryan gets all three elements working in unison here to create the daunting pressure that makes him such a threat in top half guard passing situations. When you go to control the HEAD, think about controlling the HEAD AND SHOULDERS, and soon you will be locking down opponents and getting to your winning positions
"
"The mount and the rear mount are always linked: The mount and rear mount are the two highest scoring positions in Jiu jitsu. At any given time - whenever you have one - you are only one turn of your opponents body from the other. Learning to play between mount and rear mount is a huge part of your journey to developing a devastating pinning game. If you squeeze too tightly with your legs you lose this ability to move effortlessly from one to the other. Sometimes you have to open up and relax a little to let them move themselves from mount to rear mount and vice versa. Understand however, that if you play loose with your legs, you‚Äôll generally have to play tight with your upper body to compensate. Here, Gordon Ryan expertly plays the gray zone between mount and rear mount - it could go either way at this point - which way it falls will depend on his opponent - but either way he will score the maximum and be in a fine position to finish
"
"The relationship between POSITION and TIME: From your first day in Jiu jitsu you were told that position is the most valuable commodity in Jiu jitsu. The usual reason given for this is that superior position allows you to attack without fear of an opponent being able to attack you. Certainly this imbalance of attacking opportunity is a very important reason, but there is another. Position gives you the luxury of TIME. Once a dominant position has been attained, you can create pressure over time. You can attack and FAIL multiple times - IT DOESN‚ÄôT MATTER. As long as the POSITION doesn‚Äôt fail, it doesn‚Äôt matter whether the first, second or third or fourth attempts at submission fail - just try again until you succeed - as with every failed attempt your opponent gets more tired, making the subsequent attempt more likely to break through. POSITION MAKES TIME A WEAPON, and of all the weapons at your disposal this often proves to be the dangerous of them all
"
"Making your mounted position intimidating (even when you can‚Äôt punch): The original purpose of Jiu jitsu was to build a positional game where you attain what was considered the ultimate positions in a one on one fight without weapons - the mount and rear mount - from where you could rain down uncontested punches and elbows on an opponent to finish with either the strikes themselves, or submissions based on defensive reactions to those strikes. Now you have to ask yourself - are those positions still any good when you aren‚Äôt allowed to strike in grappling matches? Well, obviously rear mount is still a great position since strangleholds from the rear are the highest rated finishing method in Jiu jitsu. What about the front mount? Is that still the best position when you are grappling. At first look I would say no. The mounted position by itself is nothing special in a grappling match. It is actually less stable than most side or north south pins and offers fewer submission options. The magic of the mount is only realized WHEN YOU BEGIN TO MANIPULATE YOUR OPPONENTS ARMS INTO COMPROMISED POSITIONS SO THAT YOU CAN DIRECTLY ATTACK HIS BREATHING AND SET UP DEVASTATING SUBMISSION ENTRIES WHILST SHUTTING DOWN HIS BEST METHODS OF ESCAPE. It is only THEN that the mount becomes a scary position again when there are no strikes involved. The problem is that the mount is usually taught as a SCORING move - that is understandable since it‚Äôs the highest scoring move in the sport - but the scoring criteria are only based on your LEG positioning, whereas the PRESSURE, SUBMISSION and CONTROL aspects of the mount come from the interaction of your legs and the management of your opponents ARMS and head. If you are going to build a devastating mount without strikes, you need to go beyond the scoring criteria and into the PRESSURE criteria, which means not being satisfied with the position itself but going the extra distance and manipulating your opponent arms and head into vulnerable positions from where even breathing is difficult, forget about escape - and from where resistance to submission holds is exceedingly difficult. Only then does the mount become scary in grappling

"Signs of success: In Jiu jitsu you‚Äôre always striving for goals - some small, some big. One of the major goals in bottom position grappling is to off balance an opponent as often as possible - the more off balance he is - the easier he is to attack. But what is a simple sign that you‚Äôve succeeded in off balancing him? WHEN YOU FORCE HIS HAND TO THE MAT. Forcing your opponents hand to the mat is one of the very best set ups from bottom guard position. If his hand is one the floor than he definitely won‚Äôt even be attempting to pass your guard until he recovers. I addition, the hand on the mat indicates a broken stance and extension - two of the surest signs that a well chosen attack is much more likely to succeed than normal. Once you recognize signs it‚Äôs a lot easier to pick your moments to attack!
"
"Had a great day training with this monster from Brazil - Nicholas Meregali came in to train with the team and impressed everyone with his attacking flair and movement. It‚Äôs very impressive to see a player who trained almost entirely in a gi adapt very quickly and effectively to no gi techniques and tactics. At the end of the day Jiu jitsu is Jiu jitsu - whether you‚Äôre wearing clothing or not - the goal is to control the body and good Jiu jitsu will always do this whether the body is covered in cloth or not. Looking forward to seeing how far this immensely talented athlete can take his no gi game!
"
"If you can control an opponents movement - you control the game: Moving targets are hard to hit. When you can stick an opponent in place and immobilize him, you can hit him with a submission hold at will. What makes the ground game so interesting is that the floor limits the means and methods by which we can move into a few predictable patterns. Once you learn those patterns you can learn to shut them down - and if you can shut down movement while still able to move yourself - you can finish anyone. When you grapple focus less on trying to perform moves and more on learning how people move on the ground and how you can interfere with that. Then all the moves you were previously focused upon become considerably easier
"
"It doesn‚Äôt seem like a big difference‚Ä¶One of the hardest truths to convince a beginner in Jiu jitsu of is that there is a world of difference between being FLAT ON YOUR BACK underneath an opponent, as opposed to BEING ON YOUR SIDE. To the untrained eye they look pretty much the same. You are lying down underneath an opponent in both cases after all. In fact the difference will determine how effective you will be from bottom position. When you‚Äôre on your side you can bear an opponents weight much more easily. You can move side to side far more readily. You can prop yourself up to an elbow or turn easily up to your knees, or reach out with your legs and catch an opponents leg. You can create an action/reaction sequence by turning from one side to another. In short - you don‚Äôt bear weight directly and you can move much more readily. Understanding the importance of this fundamental insight and making it part of your daily training is absolutely critical to your progress in most Bottom positions, particularly those your opponent is threatening to pass your legs. Next time you‚Äôre suffering under an opponents weight - turn to your side (almost always towards your opponent) and you‚Äôll feel an immediate easing of pressure and a newfound ability to move with effect
"
"Your success or failure in the standing position will come from your mastery of the crucial precursor skills: A huge mistake in most Jiu jitsu standing programs is the tendency to teach a set of takedowns as the class curriculum. Students are shown a given move, say a single leg takedown, they drill it for a while and then move to the main component of the class - the ground positions. At best this creates a class of students who can drill the moves - but it never produces a class of students who can perform the moves against a strongly resisting opponent in sparring and competition. A big part of the reason for this is of course, the fact they don‚Äôt do any sparring in the standing position; but there is another important reason - THEY ARE NEVER SHOWN THE CRUCIAL PRECURSOR SKILLS OF STANCE, MOTION, GRIP, OFF BALANCING AND POSITION THAT ACTUALLY MAKE THE TAKEDOWNS POSSIBLE AGAINST A RESISTING OPPONENT. In standing grappling, TAKEDOWNS ARE THE CULMINATION OF THE APPLICATION OF PRECURSOR SKILLS THAT HAVE TO BE APPLIED FIRST BEFORE THE TAKEDOWN CAN BE PERFORMED. If those skills are lacking - the takedown will prove impossible the moment the opponent starts resisting. These crucial precursor skills are not sexy - no one gets excited about the prospect of practicing grip fighting, stance or movement - so they get ignored. Just as you can never hope to apply an arm bar on a resisting opponent without learning the precursor skills of passing and pinning and control - you can‚Äôt apply a takedown without standing precursor skills and learning takedowns without them is simply not going to be productive - you may look ok doing your drills but you won‚Äôt be able to takedown a resisting and competitive opponent. Make sure you spend as much time learning these crucial precursor skills of the standing position as you do takedowns - they may not be as sexy but when the pressure is on they will the factor that makes you successful
"
"Jiu jitsu is an art based on closing distance to either get behind opponents or, if you‚Äôre in front of them, getting past their legs. The whole game is based on closing distance - make sure your actions in sparring reflect this essential fact. But when you close distance - don‚Äôt be naive and close distance into his legs - that‚Äôs where your opponent is most dangerous - close distance towards his back or past his legs and you‚Äôll be winning. Cultivate a mental habit of constantly pressuring forward to close distance in this manner and you‚Äôll be very successful in jiu jitsu, but if you shy back and away, you‚Äôll never be a threat to opponents

"Budgets and jiu jitsu: If your life is anything like mine, it‚Äôs probably the case that any time you make a budget for a given project, whether it be a hobby, a vacation, a dinner with friends, or whatever, and make a budget for time and expense for that project; you inevitably find that your budget is insufficient and that you have to invest more money and time than you originally believed as many unforeseen factors complicate and interfere with what initially seemed a simple task. Jiu jitsu is the same. Everything you do in jiu jitsu is done against resistance. Often this resistance is much stronger and more cunning than you initially believed it would be. When you enter a move in jiu jitsu you make an initial budget for how much energy and strength you will need to invest to make it work against the expected resistance. My advice to you is this - ASSUME THE RESISTANCE LEVEL WILL BE GREATER YOU WOULD NORMALLY ANTICIPATE AND BUDGET ACCORDINGLY - put more energy into the connection required for the application of the move than seems to be required. If you are attacking your opponents knee - don‚Äôt form your connection at your opponents knee - his resistance will almost always result in his knee slipping out of your hold. Over budget by forming the connection at the HIP so that as your opponents leg inevitably slips out to some degree as he resists, you started so high on the leg that even if you lose 15% of its length in the struggle, you‚Äôll still be above the knee and able to perform your lock. Just as engineers OVER BUILD a bridge to hold far greater weights than any average day will expose them to in the expectation that some unforeseen event may occur where the extra strength saves the day - so to with your jiu jitsu moves. Over build them to accommodate the unexpectedly high resistance that so often comes when grappling tough opponents

"Night shift: When I first came to live in America in 1991 and settled in to study and teach at Columbia University in NYC I began working nights as a nightclub/bar bouncer. I lived in two very different worlds. By day the academic life of books and research and by night sex, drugs and rock and roll. It seemed there were two populations to the city - the day shift comprised of responsible, hard working and industrious people who made the city the economic powerhouse of the nation; and the night shift comprised of pleasure seekers, drifters, scam artists and thugs. I remember the words of Travis Bickle often running through my head as I worked the front doors and dance floors of the Apple, ‚Äúall the animals come out at night...‚Äù As time passed I came to see that the city did not have two populations. Rather, it had one population that had two sides to them - the day and the night - and that hard working doctor, lawyer, city employee by day could be a very different person at night. We all have that duality of light and dark inside us and one side needs the other. The night was in a sense a release valve for the pressures of the day. Interestingly, Those people who got consumed by the night life and spent most of their time there used the day as their release valve, since too much time among that crowd created its own pressures. Here I am in my tiny Harlem apartment room in the early nineties...day shift over...night shift about to begin...

"Attacking submissions from bottom position - aim for the joint above the one you are attacking: The most common problem I see when students go to attack from bottom position is that they lose the war against gravity and let their hips sag too low. This always results in a mediocre control of the limb being attacked and inevitable failure against a resisting opponent. If you go to attack the elbow with an arm bar - AIM YOUR HIPS FOR THE SHOULDER. If you go to attack the knee with a heel hook - AIM HIPS FOR THE OPPONENTS HIPS. In other words - if you want to attack a given joint - aim to control the joint above it and you will be in an excellent position to get breaking pressure on your actual target. GET THOSE HIPS OF YOURS RISING UP HIGH OFF THE MAT AND YOU WILL FORM THE KIND OF CONNECTION REQUIRED TO BREAK STRONG RESISTING OPPONENTS. Look at Garry Tonons high hips here as he fights for a heel hook from bottom position. Pushing his hips up to his opponents hips ensures a solid entrapment of the knee he seeks to attack.
"
"Isolation: Submission is based around the notion of isolation. Your goal is to isolate one limb from the other (right leg from left leg, left arm from right arm) and then from the torso. Left on its own, a single isolated limb is easily overcome. The further a limb is taken away from the torso and from its opposite limb - the weaker it becomes. This is how stronger opponents can be defeated by weaker opponents. If you can consistently pick and isolate a limb and get it extended out and away from the torso, victory via submission will often come your way
"
"I am very happy to announce the release of my latest instructional video AGELESS JIU JITSU: WINNING WHEN YOU ARE OLDER OR LESS ATHLETIC: BOTTOM POSITION GI. In this video I look at the techniques and tactics most suited to an older jiu jitsu player, or one with a limited athletic background/abilities, and how they can build a game that enables them to be very competitive against much younger or more athletic training partners. There are definitely some techniques that are easier for such people to learn and employ and tactics which make their execution more effective. I have put out no gi videos on this topic, but I also want to cover gi Jiu jitsu as well, since many athletes in this category train predominantly in the gi and the gi offers very significant advantages in terms of control and pace control that can greatly benefit older and less athletic players. Used well, the gi adds a whole new layer of control possibilities over faster and more mobile opponents and can be used to tie them up, slow them down and inhibit their movement advantage. In addition, it adds the single best weapon that mobility compromised players have against younger, stronger and faster opponents - collar strangles. If this topic sounds like something that appeals to you - check it out - today is release day! Link in my bio and story
"
"Threats: Our behavior is immediately changed whenever we feel a significant threat. It usually puts us into a defensive mindset where we tend to be more concerned with addressing that threat than we are in attacking the opponent. This tells you something important. Whenever you want to shut down an opponents initiative - put him under some threat that throws him into a reactive/defensive mindset where he is more worried about what you‚Äôre doing to him than what he wants to do to you. Nowhere is this principle easier to apply than when you are attacking from the back. Sometimes we get so focused on holding the position or trapping an opponents arms that an opponent feels little threat beyond the position itself. As a result he can focus on his escapes and take liberties with his head and arm positions to facilitate his escapes. All that changes when you create a powerful threat of strangulation every time his hands and chin fall even a little out of defensive position. Now he has to focus so much on the strangle threat that escaping the actual position becomes forgotten as he has to focus entire on protecting his neck. There are many ways this can be applied in Jiu jitsu (and indeed - life). Comfortable opponents are difficult opponents - fearful opponents are subdued opponents - the latter are much easier to control than the former. Here Georges St Pierre does a good job of creating a strangle threat to slow down even a master of escape and counter attack like Gordon Ryan - use this principle when you feel opponents don‚Äôt respect your ability to hold a position.
"
"Two of the best martial artists I ever met: We had the pleasure of hosting one of the greatest MMA fighters of all time, Demetrius Mighty Mouse Johnson @mighty and the most well rounded overall warrior I ever met, Tim Kennedy @timkennedymma They bring a totally different game to the mats but as all great martial artist do, they find the way to use their body type to best effect. Mr Johnson was always one of the most creative and intelligent fighters in MMA and his grappling is absolutely superb also - his movement on the mats is really something to behold! Working out with them was @juanjiujitsu one of our youngsters who came with us from our year in Puerto Rico - it was a great experience for him to practice with two of his idols! In an age of grappling specialists it‚Äôs so impressive to see just how good at grappling many of the top MMA athletes are at grappling and how well they stay abreast of the changing grappling game despite their need to practice many disciplines as MMA all rounders.
"
"Extraordinary degrees of resistance: I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve  had the experience of sparring with a physically imposing opponent and you find that your moves, even your favorites, don‚Äôt seem to work against this level of physicality. You will often find that extraordinary levels of flexibility or strength can make your moves feel inadequate. When you feel this this - take heart - you‚Äôre not this first to feel this way!! Some general words of advice. If your opponent has rubber joints that seem immune to your favorite locks - focus on strangles. If you can‚Äôt strangle successfully with your arms due to freakish hand strength or jaw blocking of opponents - strangle with your legs. If your opponent has the strength to bench press you out of any form of top control - focus on getting behind him. If your opponent has a Gumby like guard that appears impossible to pass into top position - focus on taking the back instead. There is always a shift in tactics that can make up for physical freaks that frustrate your favorite lines of attack. Don‚Äôt get intimidated by unusual physical attributes - get inspired - inspired to try a new approach that shows how tactics and technique prevail or physicality
"
"Relax into your moves: When you‚Äôre learning a move it‚Äôs natural to want to try your best in applying it. When most people try their best they equate this with greater physical effort which usually manifests itself as greater muscular tension. This almost always results in lowered performance. When you learn, try to resist the urge towards tension. Try to perform the move with the minimum effort to get the job done. Don‚Äôt be hopelessly limp of course, but try to finesse your way through the move rather than using all your horsepower. In sparring you‚Äôll need to apply tension as the critical completion phase of the move approaches but the entry and initial execution you‚Äôll still want to be pretty relaxed. Get used to that feeling of relaxed efficiency in drilling - you can always add horsepower later in sparring - that‚Äôs the easy part - getting it done with finesse is the more difficult aspect
"
"How heavy an opponent feels on top of you is largely determined by how far you ca get underneath their center of gravity. If you can get under their center of gravity with your hips you‚Äôll be shocked how you can lift and move people - if you can‚Äôt they‚Äôre going to feel very heavy very quickly.
"
"Strive for precision in drilling - you‚Äôll never be able to fully replicate that level of precision in sparring, but higher your precision level in drilling, the higher it‚Äôll be in sparring and if you pass a certain threshold of precision - it‚Äôll be a winning technique
"
"Your power is in your hips: When it comes to generating physical power for we humans, the legs and hips should be your focus. Use your hands and arms to CONNECT to your opponent, but let your hips generate the HORSEPOWER. The most obvious use of this principle is in throwing people, since the act of getting hips under an opponent‚Äôs hips in order to lift is easy to observe; however, the same idea pervades almost every aspect of the sport - so make sure it pervades every aspect of your game!
"
"One of the most remarkable men I ever met: This crazy job of mine has brought me into contact with many truly fascinating people. One who really stands out will always be Tim Kennedy @timkennedymma It is very difficult in this life of ours to master even one skill - Tim Kennedy is a master of many. I watch him routinely spar against elite current MMA fighters and easily hold his own even in retirement. Then he‚Äôll do a jiu jitsu class and give hell to top grapplers. Then he will head out to a gun range and easily put five rounds into a ten inch circle at a thousand meters day or night, in any weather conditions, then he will teach handguns, knife defense. After all this he will quietly slip down to the Texas border and battle cartel human traffickers all night in night vision goggles. And the truly incredible things is that next day when I come to the gym, he‚Äôll be there before me doing some crazy workout that would flat line me in three minutes and then do another MMA sparring session with no problems! I‚Äôve never met a person like this! He can teach you about driving cars for maximum performance against armed attack, how to survive longer in freezing water, how to speak foreign languages to get by in a dozen countries - and after all this this he‚Äôs one of the nicest and most helpful people you‚Äôll ever meet - a man who always makes time to help his friends (when Georges St Pierre came to train he came up from a fire fight at the border to see his old friend, trained, and went back to the border for more!) He is a character like no other I‚Äôve met. Today he came in to help Rory MacDonald @romac_gorilla get ready for his upcoming bout. I‚Äôm looking forward to seeing my old partner in crime @firas_zahabi as we all get together to help Rory in Dallas Texas early May in PFL Thanks also to Sean Apperson for sparring help this morning - what a crew!!
"
"Traps: If you face an opponent in a fiercely combative stance and posture you leave him nothing to work with and many opponents will be very reticent about engaging with you - leading to long bouts of passive inactivity. Sometimes you do better by deliberately leaving openings that will entice an opponent to enter. Lifting an elbow may entice an under hook, leaving a foot out unguarded may entice a leg lock attempt. Remember that the first line of defense is MENTAL - awareness of the threat. If you are not only aware of the danger but knowingly creating it yourself then it is extremely unlike an opponent will be able to exploit it before you spring the trap on him. As such, it‚Äôs actually a fairly safe way to play despite the appearance of danger. This approach will often create engagement where it would otherwise not occur with a nervous opponent and it will be the best kind of engagement - engagement on your terms.
"
"Push and pull: All grappling is based on contact and connection with an opponent and a large factor in whether that connection will be favorable to you or your opponent will come from your ability to push and pull your opponent in ways that create advantage for you. PUSHING creates and maintains space; PULLING denies space. The COMBINATION of pulling and pushing off balances and breaks an opponents posture. LEARNING TO USE PUSHING AND PULLING TOGETHER KEEP SPACE WHEN YOU NEED IT, DENY SPACE WHEN YOU DON‚ÄôT AND JOLT AND OFF BALANCE OPPONENTS IN NEUTRAL POSITIONS TO BREAK THEIR STANCE IS THE FOUNDATION OF GRAPPLING. Next time you put hands on an opponent, don‚Äôt just grip them - PLAY WITH PULL AND PUSH TO GAIN ADVANTAGE FROM THE ONSET OF CONTACT!
"
"It‚Äôs Fourth of July - put some fireworks in your Jiu jitsu! It‚Äôs good to have a Jiu jitsu that has different speeds and approaches so that you can tailor them to different opponents and game plans. Sometimes a slow, controlling game works best, sometimes a fast dynamic game is what‚Äôs needed. The problem however, is that some athletes by their very nature are not fast - so how do they increase the pace of the match? Understand that there are different ways to appear fast than just movement. Consider for example the fact that almost every Jiu jitsu match has numerous stoppages in the action when athletes go out of bounds, have to tie their belt, adjust their uniform etc etc. Every time this occurs you have an opportunity hustle back to starting position faster than your opponent and increase the pace of the match without every being faster during the actual match running time. You can be the slowest guy in the whole competition and still be the first back to the start position every time there is a break in the action. This sends a clear message to your opponent - you might outpace me when the the match is on but I‚Äôll out hustle you every other time - just as in life - hustle will outlast speed. As a fast opponent tires and looks to take a longer break every time the action stops, he looks and sees you hustle to center mat and you keep the pace as high as you can between the action sequences, he will start to fade both mentally and physically. Remember, are different ways to be fast - if you‚Äôre slow - find one that works for you. Happy Fourth of July!! üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏

"The first guard you learn: When I began Jiu jitsu it was standard practice to begin the study of guard position with closed guard. There is a lot of wisdom to this. Closed guard has good value as a self defense position and that was an important consideration at that time as Jiu jitsu was closely linked to early MMA and fighting in general. As my experience as a coach grew I came to question whether closed guard was always the best choice for the first guard position for everyone. I always noticed that most beginner students had an easier time becoming effective from half guard than they did from full guard. Moreover closed guard tended to favor the longer legged athletes over short limbed athletes. Half guard seemed to work equally for all body types. In addition, half guard integrated extremely well with pin escapes and allowed students to easily transition from a defensive elbow escape directly into half guard offense. Ultimately I came to believe that there is no one guard that ought to be learned before all others. Like everything in life, different people will gravitate towards what they are best suited for. I therefore don‚Äôt dictate what kind of guard comes first but rather show a variety of fundamental guards (nothing crazy at beginner level) and let people decide whether they prefer guards based on outside control such as closed guard, or inside control such as butterfly guard or a mix of both, such as half guard. In the end, you‚Äôre going to have to learn all the various guard positions to some degree, which one you learn first doesn‚Äôt seem to affect long term development that much, so start with the ones best suited to your body. The main thing is that you gain COMPETENCE THAT LEADS TO CONFIDENCE in your bottom game as early as possible that you overcome quickly our natural trepidation about fighting from underneath tough opponents.
"
"When working from open guard - constantly seek to off balance your opponent forwards so that his hands  go to the mat: A man taken out of balance is an easy target. A huge part of your ability to develop a strong attacking game from open guard comes down to your ability to off balance your opponent and one of the clearest signs that you have been successful in doing this is your opponents hands being snapped down to the mat. Remember - if his hands are on the mat - they aren‚Äôt on you - and if they aren‚Äôt on you - he can‚Äôt pass your guard or stymie your attacks. Here, Gordon Ryan, a master of off balancing from open guard, gets his opponents hands to the mat as a way to prevent him interfering with the ashi garami he has locked up.
"
"Use your feet and hands to break their stance - then use your legs and arms to control them - then your torso position to pressure them over time - and then your whole body against a small percentage of their body at a vulnerable point to submit them - that is the nature of Jiu jitsu
"
"Weight vs weight distribution: Don‚Äôt let anyone fool you - weight is a big factor in combat sports and fighting. There is a reason why there are weight divisions. As a general rule between two athletes of roughly equal skill, the advantage will go to the bigger heavier athlete. Nonetheless there are some things you can do to make an opponents weight work in your favor. Understand that if you can make an opponent carry his own weight - EVERY POUND THAT HE CARRIES IS A POUND THAT YOU DON‚ÄôT HAVE TO CARRY - and that means a heavy man can be made to feel light, even if only briefly - that‚Äôs enough to launch an attack! When underneath opponents in guard actively seek to off balance them to get their hands on the mat carrying weight. As their arms carry the weight of their upper body it will suddenly become much easier for you to move and manipulate their remaining body weight into submissions and sweeps. Remember - it‚Äôs not just about how much your opponent weighs - but rather what percentage of his weight is actually on you - that determines your ability to engage him effectively.

"The more risks you take in the gym - the less risk you‚Äôll have to take when it counts: It‚Äôs natural to want to play a conservative, low risk game in the gym sometimes. Our training partners are often very tough and skilled. This will make you want to play a low risk game centered around your best moves and staying away from your partners best weapons. By staying in that comfort zone however, you limit your exposure to new techniques and new situations. Competition has a way of putting you in situations you didn‚Äôt count on happening and exposing you to attacks you aren‚Äôt used to defending. This is a consequence of the fact that in competition you will face opponents you know nothing about and who come from a totally different coaching program which may emphasize very different aspects of the sport in ways very different from what you do. Learn to really USE the gym environment to make yourself better. The gym is a place to TAKE RISKS AND EXPERIMENT - not a place to win at all costs - that‚Äôs what competition is for.
"
"Legends: One of my favorite aspects of Jiu jitsu is meeting legends of the sport. When I first began Jiu jitsu I was always impressed by the work of the Machado brothers. They all lived in California but were cousins of my sensei, Renzo Gracie, so we always thought of them as distant relatives. They exhibited Jiu jitsu of the very highest quality and were an inspiration to the Jiu jitsu world. Jean Jacques Machado was among the most brilliant ADCC champions of all time and Rigan Machado was widely considered as one of the very best athletes of his era and arguably the best. Certainly As a beginner in the sport I learned a lot by observing their movement and match pacing which was very advanced. In fact a move that is often associated with my students today - where from seated guard we trap both our opponents feet from behind and sweep them backwards with a push from open guard position - I learned from Jean Jacques (people always ask me if I learned it from Marcelo Garcia, but no, it was Jean Jacques who I learned it from). Many years later at EBI ADCC and UFC events and where they were coaching or spectators I would see Rigan, Jean Jacques or Carlos Machado from time to time (there were other brothers but I never met them). They were always the coolest guys and we‚Äôd talk about Jiu jitsu and crazy old matches they‚Äôd had back in the day! Here I am hanging out with one of the coolest and most laid back guys in Jiu jitsu - Rigan! Thanks to the brothers for their great role in the development and expansion of Jiu jitsu over the years - thank you for being legends in our sport.
"
"The better a move starts - the easier it gets finished: Every move in this sport is a series of steps. Complete Failure at any one step will derail the whole move - a sufficient degree of imperfection at any one step reduces the likelihood of the subsequent steps being completed. The worst is when there are noticeable imperfections in the first steps as these carry over in to all subsequent steps and now you‚Äôre forced into two directions - you now have to simultaneously redo that step to remove the faults and move on to the next step - that‚Äôs never easy. So when you make that first step - make it decisively and crisply - the better it is the easier all the others. Just as mistakes made early in a journey to a destination tend to be more damaging to navigation than mistakes made near the end when you‚Äôre close to the destination, so too, with the moves of Jiu jitsu
"
"Stop the attack‚Ä¶and then what? Traditional jiu jitsu is an inherently conservative game. Defense before all. There is wisdom in this, particularly when you remember that traditional jiu jitsu bus concerned primarily with self defense against bigger and stronger opponents. However, in modern jiu jitsu you must go beyond the old SATISFICING mindset which directs us simply to defend an opponents move; and instead opt for a MAXIMIZING mindset which asks us to not just defend a move, but also to IMMEDIATELY COUNTER as soon as the defense has topped the initial attack. Most opponents will be extended and out of position immediately after a failed attack so these counters have a very high success rate. Next time you‚Äôre under attack, go the extra distance and the second you‚Äôve blunted the opponents attack - ask yourself what your best offensive option is. Your game will take on a whole new dynamic as a result.
"
"When working from guard position - actively seek to get your opponents hands on the floor: It can be difficult learning to grapple effectively from bottom position when you begin Jiu jitsu. It always seems that the top player has everything in his favor and that you begin with a massive disadvantage. In time you‚Äôll see that this is not the case, but early on it‚Äôs natural to feel that way. One piece of advice that can greatly help speed up your development in this area is this - LOOK TO GET YOUR OPPONENTS HANDS TO THE FLOOR WHENEVER POSSIBLE. It‚Äôs not always possible nor necessary to get his hands to the floor to attack from guard, but it does create a very effective line of attack that will give you direction and focus when starting out. When you off balance an opponent and force his hands to the mat against his will, he cannot present any passing danger to you not use his hands defensively against whatever follow up attacks you employ until he recovers his balance and stance. In that time you will have an open door through which to attack. In addition, hands on floor opens his whole body to attacks. You can attack lower body or upper body with equal efficacy. Next time you‚Äôre feeling frustrated with your bottom game start by getting his hands to the mat and THEN attacking with your favorite moves. You may be pleasantly surprised that opponents who were previously shutting you down are suddenly a little easier to attack with success
"
"Following movement: Most of the time when we drill submission moves it‚Äôs done in a rather artificial situation where the move is applied and the partner taps. In reality there will be a great deal of resistance and one of the most common forms of resistance is that of rolling/twisting/turning out of the lock. It‚Äôs very important then, that you practice applying the lock through 360 degrees of motion to follow the opponents movement while maintaining secure control and then finishing in a completely different position. Getting used to this act of following defensive movement while maintaining the integrity of the lock is a key part of developing realistic submission skills that will work in tough sparring sessions

"Students old and new: In Boston filming an upcoming video with trusty friends Placido Santo @placisantos and Brian Glick @bzglick Brian was one of my most talented students over many years in the blue basement in NYC. His jiu jitsu story is one of my favorites. He was so delicate and fragile looking when he first began training over twenty years ago that on two occasions I took him aside and told him I thought it would be wise for him to stop training and find an easier and safer recreation. I have never been so happy to have been proven wrong as he developed a truly deep and impressive game both gi and no gi. Like many of my early students he chose not to compete but always he was in the gym through the MMA era with Georges St Pierre and the grappling era with the early squad all the way through until we left for Puerto Rico. It‚Äôs been a blast reliving old memories and teaching alongside him today. Tomorrow the three of us are back it! I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve all got your crazy friends at Jiu jitsu class - I think part of the appeal of jiu jitsu is the lunacy of the people around us and the reflection it offers for our own lunacy to be doing such a crazy sport! üòÇüòúüòÇ

"Heavyweights: People are often surprised to hear that I train many heavyweights the same way I train lightweights. Too often people underestimate the degree to which bigger people can play a smooth and technically adept game that involves inversions and flexible guard play as well as many lightweights. When I come to assess to coach someone I don‚Äôt judge them by their WEIGHT and SIZE, but rather by their MOVEMENT POTENTIAL. Some big people can move extremely well and in these cases, I teach them the same program as the lightweights. Here is Big Dan Manasoiu, at six foot seven (200 cm) and over 250 pounds (115 kg)  he certainly is big, yet you can see he inverts into leg locks as well as any lightweight on his way to winning gold at European ADCC trials. Don‚Äôt let people tell you how you should grapple based on size. I‚Äôve seen Small people play a powerful top pressure game well against bigger opponents, I‚Äôve seen big men roll around the floor with the speed and agility of a mongoose. Movement quality, not size is the best predictor of how you should play.

"I am very happy to see that my teacher Renzo Gracie has just been admitted to the ADCC Hall of Fame! Renzo was my teacher from white belt to black belt and it was my greatest honor to be his longest serving teacher at his school in NYC. He was two times ADCC champion and won a super fight against former ADCC champion Sanae Kikuta in 2017 - nineteen years after his first ADCC gold medal!! Mr Gracie was a true pioneer in ADCC - the events were totally different in those early days than they are now. You were often matched against people you‚Äôd never seen before, against styles you had no experience of, in a rule set that was totally new. Renzo competed while running his own school in a city and training mostly for MMA instead of specialized grappling and coaching himself - an amazing feat. In that time he created an room of great talent in a city that had no Jiu jitsu culture whatsoever and yet produced great athletes, champions and teachers such as Ricardo Almeida, Matt Serra, Rodrigo Gracie, Shawn Williams and many more. In time he became a very important coach and cornerman for Roger Gracie and cornered him to one of the greatest ADCC performances of all time at the Long Beach ADCC in California. I am so happy to see this great athlete,  teacher and mentor get recognition from ADCC for his achievements! And Renzo, from me and all your students from the earliest years to today - thank you for all you did for us, for giving us technical vision when we were blind, the best training room an athlete could hope for, a friendly word when we needed to be picked up, a kick in the ass when we needed to be pushed and the best times of our lives. Thank you Sensei - and congratulations! ü§óü§óü§ó No one deserves it more üáßüá∑üá∫üá∏

"What was the first guard you learned? Everyone agrees that guard position is one of the absolute foundations of Jiu jitsu. The heavy emphasis on guard play is probably the single most distinctive part of Jiu jitsu that separates it most from the other grappling arts. There are many types of guard - which did you learn first? Most students begin with closed guard. There are good reasons for this. Closed guard represents one of the great ideals of Jiu jitsu - the ability to attack while not being oneself open to the opponents attack - an opponent can‚Äôt attack you with passes or submissions until he first opens your guard. However, many students struggle to actually apply the major moves from closed guard as the position overall often feels very unfamiliar and unnatural to a beginner. I often find that beginners do better as far as effectiveness from bottom position is concerned with half guard rather than closed guard. So when it‚Äôs time to teach bottom position to a raw beginner, try using closed guard to illustrate important concepts and half guard to make them effective in sparring in minimum time.
"
"The guard position will always be the most important position in Jiu jitsu: The guard most always be the foundation of your game. The guard represents the single best method of fighting effectively from bottom position for extended periods of time that enables you to protect yourself from a single unarmed attacker in a real fight and to employ almost the full arsenal of submissions against an opponent whilst also allowing you sweep your way into top position or stand back up to your feet without exposing your back if the situation should demand it. Nature doesn‚Äôt do a very good job preparing us for fighting effectively from our back. If you watch two completely untrained people fight on the ground whoever gets top position generally prevails. However, with knowledge and training you can make this position perform in ways that seem near miraculous. However much of a struggle and no matter how initially frustrating it may be, make sure you focus the majority of your early training on bottom position and developing a solid guard. Whenever you are outgunned, exhausted or smaller, it will be the first and best refuge for you to shelter in and regain the initiative.
"
"Action and reaction: When you start jiu jitsu it seems there are so many moves to learn that when it‚Äôs time for sparring you get locked into a mindset of MOVE PERFORMANCE, that is, a desire to perform a move that you‚Äôve selected as well as you can, come what may. There is no thought as to what your opponent is doing - only what you want to do. This is totally understandable when you‚Äôre starting out, but at some point you‚Äôll want to get away from that and start paying attention to your opponents REACTIONS to your moves and use THAT as the basis of your technique selection rather than just arbitrarily selecting a move and trying to force an application of it against resistance. Just as a good conversationalist doesn‚Äôt just talk his own thoughts, but rather LISTENS to the other person and talks in response to what he hears, so too, a good jiu jitsu player listens to the movements of his opponent second by second in response to his moves and responds. It takes two in jiu jitsu - make sure everything you do takes the other fellow into account
"
"Less contact - less effectiveness: Jiu jitsu is the art and science of establishing physical connection with an opponent that enables you to control their movement more than they can control yours and use that control to steer them towards submission. The more contact and connection they can establish on you when they are in good position, the more trouble they can create for you. Accordingly a big part of the game is that of denying connection and contact when it does not suit you. When you are working in a talented opponents guard, try to deny him useful connection whilst establishing your own. His primary connectors are his feet and lower legs. If you control and monitor those you make his game quite difficult. Learning to distinguish between contact and connection that is beneficial and that which is hazardous is a big part of your development. Look how Nicky Ryan controls feet to deny an opponents guard connection whilst simultaneously closing distance to get into a position to establish his own connections i

"Getting ready for Austin Texas! Gordon Ryan, Garry Tonon and I are getting ready for a big move to Austin Texas to begin teaching and training. I will teach a seminar here in Puerto Rico to raise money for local Jiu jitsu schools who supported us in our time here - it will be sad to leave the Island but I‚Äôm excited for the future. Going to Texas was always fun adventure for competitions - now it will be to make a home! Initially we will teach out if a small local school Renzo Gracie Austin, but we will start scouting for our own place as we become more familiar with the city. The fun part will be re-learning how to drive! I have not driven a car since 1991! üòÇüòÇüòÇ I will have to get a driver‚Äôs license like a teenager and learn to handle a modern car! üòÇüòÇ I am pretty sure I will end up in some kind of vehicular disaster in the first week! üòÇüíÄüíÄüòÇ Can‚Äôt wait to get in the ground next week and start the journey to make Texas a Jiu jitsu powerhouse!
"
"The moment of opportunity: So many times in a match their is a moment where both athletes can score, both are vulnerable and both can attack - victory in the exchange will go either to the one with the stronger single attack or the best follow up attack(s) - so make very sure you practice both approaches
"
"If you can feed off your opponents defensive reactions - you‚Äôll never be at a loss for the next move: Resistance to every move you attempt is the norm in combat sports. No one is going to let you get your moves for free. You‚Äôll have to fight against resistance for every move you ever attempt. So plan your game around the next move(s). When you have instant follow ups to the expected resistance you‚Äôll never stop at resistance as most people do - you‚Äôll move on at a rate that will will soon overwhelm your opponent‚Äôs ability to keep up - and THAT‚ÄôS when you consistently win.
"
"How you end today‚Äôs training session will determine tomorrow‚Äôs: When most people end a Jiu jitsu training session they are typically rather exhausted. Understandably they usually either show and go home to rest or hang out on the mats and take a mental break with small talk and banter with their buddies. In most cases this is fine, but very often I find that this time immediately after class is one of the most productive to teach a quick lesson in response to a problem i saw students experience in that session. Problems irk us. When we experience a problem on the mat that irritates us, a good solution will be much more memorable and likely to ‚Äústick‚Äù in our minds precisely because the initial irritation creates a demand for knowledge, and that demand will make the lesson memorable. Here we all get together for a post class discussion of a problem students ran into - typically I will state the problem and offer initial solutions and bounce ideas around as we experiment with solutions. Some work well for some students, others for other students. These last thoughts often provide a good lead in to tomorrow‚Äôs class - and this is the important thing - for ONLY WHEN CLASSES BUILD UPON THE LESSONS OF PREVIOUS CLASSES IN A CONTINUOUS LINE OF PROGRESS CAN YOU BUILD TOWARDS YOUR LONG TERM GOALS IN THE SPORT
"
"Pushing past resistance: Everything you do in jiu jitsu, you do against resistance. Your opponent knows most of your moves and the counters to them. Learning to overcome resistance is one of the great keys to consistently good performances on the mat. When it comes to dealing with resistance there is a middle path that you must learn to steer. You don‚Äôt want to quit on a move at the first sign of resistance - you‚Äôll never complete any moves that way. Nor do you want to persist so long on a move that‚Äôs been stopped that you exhaust yourself or fall into a trap. Finding that middle found is a lifelong journey. You can learn a move in minutes but it‚Äôll take you years to figure out when to persist with it and when to switch to something else when applying it against a resisting opponent. Make sure you pair your moves with another move that works in the opposite direction. That way you play them against each other when you encounter resistance. Then is just a matter of experimenting over time to see how far you should go with one until you switch to the other.
"
"The first battle is always inside your own mind: Whenever we are in a critical situation, whether it‚Äôs one where we‚Äôre are close to losing or close to winning your mind will naturally start to get excited. Excitement can often degenerate into panic in bad situations and tunnel vision in good situations. You always do your best work in a state of relative calm - jiu jitsu is no exception. When you get into a situation that evokes fear or excitement - win the battle to maintain calm inside your head so that you have a better chance to win the battle on the mat!
"
"The weaknesses of jiu jitsu - working the standing position: There is no question that Jiu jitsu as an art has its weaknesses. When I began teaching  jiu jitsu I identified five prominent weaknesses that I wanted to address as I taught. The first was leg locks. The second was takedowns and grappling in the standing position. The third was third was the widespread tendency in jiu jitsu culture to make a gentleman‚Äôs agreement to play the roles of guard and guard passer and almost completely neglect the possibility of heisting or standing up from bottom and using the change in elevation to score takedowns and reversals. Fourth was the widespread belief that training in a gi somehow made you better at no gi grappling. This odd belief held back the development of no gi technique for many years. Fifth was the failure of jiu jitsu coaching to keep pace with the development of jiu jitsu technique. The techniques of jiu jitsu evoked with impressive rapidity, the the methods coaches used to teach the technique did not evolve at all. My coaching career has essentially been an attempt to overcome these five major weaknesses that I observed in jiu jitsu. I believe it is fair to say now that leg locks are no longer a weakness in jiu jitsu, but rather they have now become a strength relative to the other grappling arts. I also believe that very few people still believe the fable that you need to train in a gi in order to maximize your technical development in no gi jiu jitsu and as a result the evolution of no gi technique in the last decade has skyrocketed. The standing position and takedowns is still under developed in jiu jitsu. It‚Äôs getting far better than when I began the sport, but it still has a way to go if jiu jitsu is to mature fully as a grappling art and attain the perfection that I truly believe it capable of. It is my earnest belief that Jiu jitsu must develop its own standing game - a game appropriate for its unique rule set - rather than just pirate a few moves from wrestling and judo and be happy with that. This will require a deep and sincere study, with much inspiration taken from wrestling and judo, but even more modification and adaptation for Jiu jitsu
"
"Calm between the storms: The general pattern of Jiu jitsu sparring is of relatively long periods of little activity followed by bursts of intense hyperactivity followed again by a longer period of relative inactivity. This cycle continues on until victory is scored. These periods of apparent inactivity are in fact, very active, but in subtle ways. The athletes are jockeying for some small, often imperceptible advantage that will make a sudden dramatic move more likely to succeed. Once the advantage is gained there is a strong attack. This necessitates an equally strong counter from the opponent which creates the sudden increase in activity level that will continue either until victory or failure for either athlete to score and they make a mutual agreement that it‚Äôs not worth pursuing what they sought and they go into another quiet phase of subtle set ups. Learning play with this shift of gears is a big part of your development. Beginners tend to just sprint the whole match and get tired very quickly. If you can‚Äôt get a quick win this approach condemns you to defeat. Going to passive for too long creates an activity level so low that you won‚Äôt tire your opponents and you can‚Äôt build the pressure that wins matches decisively. Somewhere in the middle is the right path. Learn to juggle the need for periods of low energy expenditure where the primary emphasis is on tactics and set ups, with short bursts of intense activity where the primary emphasis is on scoring and finishing. Play the two together seamlessly and you‚Äôll be able to grapple a long time and out sufficient pressure on an opponent to fatigue them to a degree that a decisive breakthrough is much more likely to occur.
"
"Navigating from neutral to advantage: The story of every jiu jitsu match is the same - your quest to advance over time from neutral positions (starting) to advantageous positions (finishing). Usually this cycle has to be repeated several times before a decisive victory is achieved as your opponent will typically escape quite often when you get a good position on him. Like any other act of navigation in your life, you have options. Just as you have a favorite way to drive home, the shortest way home, the most scenic way home, a new and interesting way home, the long way home etc so too in jiu jitsu, you have many ways from your standard starting positions into your finishing positions. The most important thing in this sport is to have A CLEAR SENSE OF DIRECTION from all the major starting positions. No sense of direction will immediately result in no movement and no movement means your opponent will swarm all over you. If you don‚Äôt have a clear sense of direction from a given starting point, you need to figure that out first before you can expect any techniques to succeed. Remember - techniques without direction are random - direction without technique won‚Äôt even get started. KNOW WHERE YOU WANT TO GO AND KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO TO GET THERE and you will be very successful in this game

"I am very happy to announce the release today of my latest instructional video AGELESS JIU JITSU: WINNING WHEN YOU‚ÄôRE OLDER OR LESS ATHLETIC. This video is designed to help jiu jitsu players who feel compromised by either their age or a lack of athletic background and who find performing many of the moves of Jiu jitsu problematic but still want to be effective. There are certain moves, positions and tactics that can enable older or slower, less mobile players to be very effective against younger, fitter opponents - this video lays out a game plan for exactly that. I always felt that this was an area I could help people with since I am approaching late fifties in age and I have a crippled leg that always severely compromised my mobility on the mats. Despite that I was able to develop a game that made me quite effective and I would like to be able to do the same for other people. If you feel like age or a lack of athletic background is affecting your learning, maybe check it out and see if it can help! Link in my Instagram bio
"
"All reversals and sweeps score the same: In most grappling sports there are rewards for amplitude when performing takedowns - the bigger the takedown - the more you score. In Jiu jitsu takedowns and guard sweeps, there is no reward for amplitude - they all score the same two points regardless of their form. You‚Äôre rewarded only for the fact that you went from bottom position to top position. So even a scrappy, ugly, stop-start reversal will score the same as a beautiful classical sweep. Keep this in mind at all times, because often there will be opportunities to simply come up from bottom and tackle an opponent or go behind them, or even just rush them down after a failed initial sweep attempt. Again, there only has to be a reversal of top and bottom position to get a score - so anything that does that is a win no matter what it looks like.

"All alone in a crowded room: most of our Jiu jitsu lives are lives in a community of friends and teammates, coaches and mentors. You can have great support behind you to help in preparation, but at the end of the day - you walk out on the mat alone. In your own time, focus on building the inner confidence to let all the work you did with your friends in preparation shine when you‚Äôre out there all alone. Managing the separation of communal training with the aloneness of competition is a big part of dealing with your toughest matches
"
"Stopping movement facilitates submission: When you get into a submission hold the opponent will usually go into some rather extreme defensive movements. It‚Äôs not unusual to find yourself twisting and turning wildly as you try to follow his defensive movements. Learning to use the IMMOBILIZATION potential of submission holds first and the BREAKING/STRANGLING second helps a lot in the application of submission holds against tough opponents. Take the extra time to focus first on stopping movement and then when you‚Äôve achieved that - THEN show your breaking/strangulation prowess. It‚Äôs quite difficult to impose breaking mechanics on a moving opponent - stifling movement first makes the task a lot easier!
"
"Greatness: How great you become in any given endeavor will always be assessed by the degree of difficulty of the barriers you had to overcome to get to the top. Just as the Lion became king of the jungle not by living among sheep, but by dominating a world of elephants, hyenas, Buffalo, leopards and crocodiles, so too the greatness of an athlete will be determined, not just by his own ability, but by the greatness of the athletes he faces. Thus in his quest for greatness, Gordon Ryan owes a debt to the greatness of his toughest opponent Andre Galvao. Mr Galvao stood at the highest levels of the grappling world for two decades and atop ADCC for a full decade, setting records for super fight longevity that were truly astounding. He had a deep and complete skill set married to superb tactical sense. Like a true martial artist he evolved greatly over the course of his career, moving easily from no gi to gi, across weight divisions, culminating in a game based around standing position that enabled him to defeat many legends of the game with relative ease. Mr Galvao fought his match with Gordon like a Lion, showing great tenacity and skill. The relationship between opponents is a strange one. You end up knowing each other very well as each studies the other and interacts in the build up. In the end, the greater your opponent, the greater you can become through victory, and yes, even in defeat. In the quest for greatness you end up owing more to your opponents than perhaps anyone else, since they are the true measure of where you stand. Andre Galvao stood against the best of the best for over a decade. In this greatest of all grappling events, it was the height of his legacy that made it such a special confrontation and such a memorable event.

"Tactics without technique won‚Äôt work at all; but technique without tactics will never allow you to beat someone as good as you or better. One is more important than the other, but you‚Äôll need both to maximize your potential.

"Countdown: Garry Tonon successfully weighed in for his bout tomorrow night against the very talented Caucasus Russian grappler Shamil Gasanov tomorrow morning local time (evening in the USA). The event features four different combat sports - Muay Thai, Kickboxing, Jiu Jitsu and MMA. All four are represented by the very best. Muay Thai icon Superlek is the main event, Mr Tonon is the co-main event.  Also featured is a jiu jitsu bout between Tammi Musumeci, talented sister of Jiu jitsu phenom Mikey Musumeci against the very dynamic Amanda Alequin - this should be fireworks! I always like these multidisciplinary events - the only minor drawback is that MMA and Jiu jitsu matches will have to be fought in a ring rather than cage which is not optimal, but worth it here given the opportunity to see the very best Muay Thai and kickboxing talent in the homeland of the sport. Hope you all enjoy the show!
"
"Control time: Time is a huge factor in combat sports in many different ways. In grappling one of the most important facets of time is what we might call CONTROL TIME - this is the amount of time you can maintain control over the movement of a resisting opponent in a position that leads directly into submission. THE LONGER YOU CAN MAINTAIN CONTROL TIME UNDER STRESS, THE MORE LIKELY YOU WILL GO ON TO SUBMIT YOUR OPPONENT, particularly if you can make multiple attempts at submissions from that control position. There is a direct relationship between the amount of time you can consistently control opponents in positions that lead directly to submission and your submission rate. Take your favorite positions from which you can transition directly to submission - ashi garami, Kimura, front headlock, juji gatame - whatever you want - AND PRACTICE HOLDING OPPONENTS IN THISE POSITIONS UNDER CONTROL FOR EXTENDED PERIODS - if you get a submission- release and keep going. When you can hold and control these winning positions for minutes at a time there will be very few people who will be able to stop your submission offense.

"New York: My life is probably a lot like yours. It‚Äôs been filled with moments of success followed by failure, of joy following sadness. Cycles of up and down, good and bad. Through all of that there was one constant in my life - New York City. Whenever I traveled around the country and the globe there was always a special feeling of happiness when I returned and saw that unmistakable skyline. Washington may be America‚Äôs capital, but New York is the WORLD‚ÄôS capital. It attracts the best and most driven people from around the globe into a concentrated mess of industry, innovation, eclecticism and evolution. It either builds you up or smashes you down. This was reflected in the many incredible teachers and students I had here in New York over quarter of a century. I had many great teachers and many great friends, but in the end, New York was the greatest teacher and friend of them all. It taught me the power of motivation allied with diversity of inputs funneled into a common purpose toughened and refined by open competition. The city has changed a lot in my time here - I‚Äôve changed a lot too - but my changes aren‚Äôt complete yet - there are some projects ahead - and they won‚Äôt be done in New York City. No change is permanent, the future is always uncertain, plans can change in the face of changing circumstances and you can always come back from where you‚Äôre going, but for now it‚Äôs  time to move on in order to move forward. I will soon be moving with some of my students to Puerto Rico to try a new philosophy of teaching and refining our beloved art that I hope can widen our reach and contribute something significant to the continued growth of Jiu jitsu.

"Strong performance at East Coast ADCC trials in Atlantic City!  Team New Wave had a fine performance at the hotly contested ADCC East Coast trials today and yesterday. Big Daniel Manasoiu @jiujitsugiant led the charge with a 100% submission rate through to gold medal and winning his spot into the big show - ADCC 2024!  Dominick Mejia @dominatormejia had an incredible showing - he performed like a human highlight reel over two days with many dramatic matches and dynamic moves. He won silver in a truly memorable display. Helena Crevar @helenajiujitsugirl won all her matches by submission leading up to final but lost via takedown and negative pull in an action packed final - another amazing performance overall by this outstanding teenage prodigy that will only help direct her training for what is clearly an exceptional future. Oliver Taza won bronze in the ultra competitive 77kg division with many outstanding submissions along the way. Several of the other youngsters had great displays that point to a bright future ahead. Now we will all head back to Austin for preparations for upcoming shows and ultimately West Coast trials. Hope you all enjoyed the show!!

"I am very happy to announce the release of my latest instructional video STANDING2GROUND TAKEDOWNS AND STANDING SKILLS FOR JIU JITSU. I go over the essential standing skills that make takedowns possible - stance, motion, contact and gripping and the all important breaking of your opponents balance and stance. Then we go over the best takedowns from neutral standing position. Takedowns and standing position can be very different in jiu jitsu than other grappling arts due to the difference in rule sets and priorities. The major theme presented in this series is that in the long term of jiu jitsu is to make significant progress in one of its traditional weaknesses - the standing position - it must develop its own standing game. The point is not to MIMIC wrestling and judo, but rather to MODIFY, ADAPT and ADD to them until jiu jitsu has it own character suited to its own rule set. I believe the most significant progress in Jiu jitsu in the coming years will be the standing game and even more important - the interface between standing and ground that is the true emphasis in jiu jitsu rather than pure takedowns per se. If you‚Äôre interested - check it out! Link in my Instagram story

"Damn Austin - you scary! Austin Texas may not be one of America‚Äôs biggest cities, but in less than a year it has become a jiu jitsu powerhouse as evidenced by the roster call for the upcoming ADCC World Championships with a staggering number of competitors coming out of this city. New Wave has Gordon Ryan, Garry Tonon, Nicholas Meregali, Giancarlo Bodoni, Luke Griffith, Daniel Manasoiu and Oliver Taza all confirmed. B Team has Craig Jones, Nicky Ryan, Nick Rodriguez, Jay Rodriguez, Ethan Crelinsten, Izaak Mitchell all confirmed. Six blades has ADCC legend Xande Ribiero and heavyweight juggernaut Victor Hugo confirmed. Fight Factory has William Tackett confirmed. This means a staggeringly high percentage of the total competitors will come from this small city in Texas that previously never figured in jiu jitsu discussions at all. Well done Austin! I have always believed that a small group of motivated people who build a culture of continual improvement over time can create results out of all proportion to their numbers - this town is proof of it!

"Give a little to gain a lot: Most of the time when you have top position you will be looking to restrict space between you and your opponent and keep a tight chest to chest connection to main your pin. When it‚Äôs time to submit opponents however, you can often profit handsomely by giving some space for an opponent to move into. As long as you control which space is made available this will enable you to funnel your opponents movement into whatever trap you have set. The idea of pinning is to PREVENT movement - but the idea of pinning into submission is to DIRECT movement in directions that favor you. Look how Gordon Ryan gives space for an opponent to move into at the chest,  whilst ensuring that the area that really counts - underhook - exhibits no space at all. As such he allows the opponent to maneuver into his own defeat.
"
"The pin is a means to an end - not the end itself: In grappling pinning is a truly crucial skill. Learning to immobilize opponents is one of the keys to finishing them. Without immobilizing first it‚Äôs very hard to consistently enter into submissions. However, don‚Äôt stop at immobilization - that‚Äôs the path but it‚Äôs not the destination - the destination is submission. Make sure when you‚Äôre practicing that you always seek to go beyond holding opponents down and go into finishing scenarios. This can be frustrating at first, since the extra movement almost always results in a diminishing of your control and opponents will often slip out of the pin. You have to get past this hurdle and learn to take the risk of extra movement to get the highest reward
"
"Placido!! Did you hit your training partner in the nuts AGAIN?! #yournutsarenotmyproblem
#itsalwaystheoneswhotrytolookinnocent
"
"Don‚Äôt just attack the submission - attack his base of support AND the submission and you‚Äôll double your chances of success: It hard enough to defend a well applied submission hold at the best of times - it‚Äôs considerably more difficult when you‚Äôve been knocked down to an awkward position from where you have no ability to apply strength or movement. Make use of this insight whenever you can. If you catch an opponent in a good lock - look immediately to go the extra distance and lock them out if their base of support so that they have TWO tasks - they have to defend the submission hold AND recover their base - the former is not possible until they perform the latter. This will give you a much greater chance of finishing them than just the hold itself. Here, Gordon Ryan makes an already very dangerous triangle even more so by knocking his opponent down - defending from a broken down position like this will be nearly impossible
"
"The undisputed king of positions - the back: As much as I love leg locks and arm locks, if I could only have one submission for the rest of my life I would choose strangles from the back without hesitation. Indeed, it is no exaggeration to see you could build an EXTREMELY effective style of Jiu jitsu that had absolutely no leg locks, no arm locks, no guillotine, Darce strangles etc only a rear strangles. It would be equally effective gi and no gi, grappling and fighting, standing or ground, sport and self defense. You can get the back from anywhere. You can use scrambles to the back when guard passing, as a counter to most leg locks, at the completion of any sweep or takedown, as a follow on from any pin. You could become a dominant world champion with the rear strangle as your only submission hold provided your positional game was up to the task of reliably getting you to the back. Thankfully we don‚Äôt have to make the choice of a single submission and so we can learn a bunch of them to make the game easier, but still, lesson learned - study your pathways to the back and your finishes from there - it  will never let you down in any scenario in which you may find yourself. Here, Craig Jones shows his back mastery as he locks in on a much bigger opponent to build pressure to a finish. Note the use of closed wedges around hip line and shoulder line via seatbelt and body triangle to create extraordinary levels of control,  along with a punishing level of discomfort for the opponent and give him time to assess the hand fight leading to the strangle
"
"Thank you: Team New Wave just completed one of the most successful team performances in ADCC history. This was truly remarkable given that one year ago a team split resulted in around three quarters of our competition athletes leaving. It was a dark time. We had no gym of our own, Our main athlete Gordon Ryan was so sick from a long term stomach illness he was contemplating leaving the sport, Garry Tonon was mostly focused on MMA, we were strangers in a new city - it seemed the grappling program I‚Äôd built over the years was dead in the water. Yet eleven months later we surpassed even the great success we had in 2019 ADCC. This success had many factors and I would like to thank the people who helped make it happen. First, my students. I took on new students to help those who had remained after the split. They gave everything they had in a very tough year of training up to four sessions a day every day. There are too many to mention, but in particular Oliver Taza, Luke Griffith, Dan Manasoiu, Nicholas Meregali  and Giancarlo Bodoni trained with inspiring dedication and grit to get to championship level in record time. My remaining senior students Gordon Ryan, Garry Tonon and Georges St Pierre took on an inspirational role as mentors and coaches while at the same time continuing their own growth and progress - an incredible achievement on their part. From the bottom of my heart - thank you. Second, my new local students here in Austin who flocked to my classes in small local schools to make tremendous progress and become worthy training partners to the competitors in record time whilst still working their daily professional and family obligations - thank you. Third, The staff and management of @roka who provided a stable training gym for a year of intense preparation and asked for nothing in return and showed such kindness of spirit to us that made us fight that much harder to improve and represent them well at the world championships - thank you. Fourth, to Bernardo Faria and Michael Zenga of @bjj.fanatics who help my students craft their teaching skill and become financially sound. Thank you all so much for the kindness, work and sacrifice you all showed.

"Know what you want - make a flexible plan to get there: People who know what they want usually get there. Those who know what they want and have a good plan to navigate their way get there get there often. Those who know what they want and have a flexible plan that adjusts to the many variables and contingencies that life throws at us over time almost always get there. Those that have no idea what they want have to be content with whatever fate gives them - sometimes good, sometimes bad, but never an expression of your will. Your work outs must reflect this pattern. If you come in with no goal and no plan, the worth of your workout will be determined by those around you, sometimes good, sometimes bad, never an expression of a vision you have of yourself as a better player in the future, but only a vague hope that one day maybe you‚Äôll be good. If you come in with a clear goal and a plan to enact it that can change intelligently according to changing circumstances over time you will find over time that goals get realized and the you of today beats the you of yesterday, just as the you of tomorrow will defeat the you of today. You carry a lot into every workout - your physicality, tactics, technique, enthusiasm, passion, worries, anxieties, fatigue, injuries, burn out - but the most important thing you can ever bring is A GOAL AND A PLAN

"Last mission in Puerto Rico: I will be teaching a seminar in Puerto Rico on September 19. I am sad to be leaving the Island. Though there were obviously some sad elements to our time here, there were many more great ones. I will be eternally grateful to the many friends we made here and who generously gave time and resources to help us in our time in Puerto Rico. 100% of the money made in this seminar will go to gyms who let us train on their mats with no expectations of reward and to the Puerto Rico Jiu jitsu federation to help fund competitions for the many talented young athletes in the Island to show their skills in the future. We have greatly enjoyed showing our approach to the game in Puerto Rico over the last year and I look forward to a last chance to showcase it to a wider audience. ¬°Deseandoles lo mejor! ¬°Nos vemos ahi!!

"Victory at IBJJF World Championships! Luke Griffith of New Wave Jiu jitsu won the Brown Belt division at the world championships today. Luke moved from South Africa  to Austin Texas around seven months ago after losing a match at the European/African ADCC trials. Since then he won the second European ADCC trials, represented at the 2022 ADCC World Championships where he went 0-0 with three time gold medalist Yuri Simoe, won two out of two professional WNO grappling matches, became Pan Am IBJJF Champion and now World Champion! He is a truly amazing student with a prodigious work rate and great determination - well done Luke!! ü§óü§ó

"When riding the back - prioritize the upper body connection first: In Jiu jitsu you get rewarded for the back only when you sink your hooks into your opponent - no hooks - no points. It‚Äôs natural to think therefore, that the hooks are the thing to focus on. While the hooks are certainly an important part of the position, it is your arms connecting your chest to your opponents back that really enable to stay locked to a resisting opponent for extended periods of time.  ONCE YOUR UPPER BODY CONNECTION IS SET, YOU CAN ALWAYS WORK YOUR WAY INTO LOWER BODY HOOKS. Ultimately you will need both upper and lower body connection to succeed from the back - but if circumstances means that for a period of time you can only have one - choose upper body
"
"Direction of force: When it comes time to apply breaking pressure on a good one of the most important factors is DIRECTION OF FORCE. It easy to focus primarily on GENERATION of force ie trying to generate as much force as possible. That‚Äôs good, but lots of force applied in the wrong directions won‚Äôt do much good. Focus more on the most efficient DIRECTION to apply whatever force you can generate - that‚Äôs what usually gets the most decisive results.
"
"New talent: Most people measure the worth of a training program on the basis of the best people in the room. I prefer to assess it on the time it takes new people in the room to make progress towards the level expressed by the best people in the room. Nick Ortiz is a very talented Puerto Rican grappler who has been working with us in NYC and now in Puerto Rico. Last weekend he competed in a local show in Boston after helping me film a new instructional video there. Look at the relaxed poise of his leg lock game as he expresses the fundamental squad leg lock themes of targeting both legs, switching from form of ashi garami leg control to another to compensate for an opponents defensive movement (switching from one leg to another, from front side to backside back to front side finish and from inside foot position to outside to counter an opponents defensive turn), culminating in a fine 50/50 finish on the inside shoulder. Well done Nick Ortiz!
"
"When the workouts done: Back home in Austin and in the gym getting athletes ready for upcoming grappling shows. I love the feeling of returning from a show and going straight from the airport back to the gym - that feeling of hitting the ground running is a good one. Gordon Ryan is getting ready for a very tough match against the very talented Pedro Merinho @pedromarinhojj who has had a stellar last twelve months in grappling. They will meet at WNO here in Austin Texas on @flograppling  Now the workouts over but an empty dojo is a fine place to figure out the plan for tomorrow when the dojo is full once again‚Ä¶

"Heading into Boston after a day of filming: I‚Äôve always loved Boston - driving in at night the skyline looks as beautiful as ever‚Ä¶.the snow has melted and the city‚Äôs looking good. I used to read about Boston as a child growing up in New Zealand - the cradle of the revolution - I was fascinated then and still am today
"
"Observation: The model of development in Jiu jitsu ought always to be as close as possible to the classical model of development in science - of the interaction of hypothesis, experiment and observation and assessment of results in a never ending rotation that gives provisional but increasingly better answers to the questions you ask. When it comes time to asses the worth of given moves, the merits of your training program, your performance of technique and tactics, nothing beats observation. As an athlete you must keenly observe your performances and make adjustments based in the feedback your eyes give you. Training in itself is is the most important thing in the short term, but for long term progress almost as important is observation and assessment of that training that allows you to bring the results of today‚Äôs workout to tomorrow‚Äôs workout so that a compounding effect can be attained - only then can you grow over time to the level that you aspire to

"The story of the Kenyan runner: One day early in my coaching career I was teaching in Manhattan, when a slender but athletic fellow came in and enquired about beginning Jiu jitsu. He explained that he was a former Olympic level runner for Kenya in the 3000m Steeplechase. He now lived in NYC where he made a living as a running partner - he had clients who liked to jog and he ran next to them as a pacemaker/coach. He was booked all day every day and so must have been in phenomenal shape as he essentially ran all day for a living. He had seen some MMA and was curious to try some grappling. We arranged to meet on Sunday morning for an introduction class since that was the only free time he had and begin a Jiu jitsu session. That Sunday he came in for class and began with a warm up jogging around the dojo. When you see most people run (myself Included) it‚Äôs a rather sorry sight - a clumsy, heavy gait where the movement seems forced and inefficient. This man ran like a mix of gazelle and cheetah. I watched in amazement and admiration as he effortlessly performed lap after lap with steps so long and light that it appeared he barely touched the ground. Never in my life before or since have seen such perfection in running movement. After a while he came to begin grappling. We did some basic pin escapes and drilled them for a while and then began light sparring with him trying to escape some pins. Shockingly after just a few minutes the runner was completely exhausted, this despite the fact that he appeared a thousand times fitter than most Jiu jitsu athletes will ever be. We stopped and rested and then went again. This time both of his hamstrings went into spasm from exertion and we had to stop the lesson as he was totally exhausted and had to run with his clients for the rest of the day. It was a surprising thing to see someone so athletically gifted in one area become so tired so quickly in another. Of course if I tried to do his workout I would be equally exhausted also. It‚Äôs a valuable lesson that there is much specificity to what we call fitness. Make sure SPARRING is the basis of your fitness work - nothing else creates the specificity of Jiu jitsu as well
"
"Most times you have a juji gatame arm bar you also have a triangle available: The positioning  for arm bars and triangles is such that WHENEVER YOU HAVE ONE, YOU ALMOST ALWAYS HAVE THE OTHER AVAILABLE. Triangles have the inherent advantage that they a locked around your opponents head and shoulder and hence much tighter. Also, triangles offer the dual benefits of a strangle as well as an arm lock and also, you can attack the joints from a triangle as well or even better than you can from a conventional juji gatame position. For these reasons it is often worth your time to switch your legs from the classic arm bar to a triangle when working for your submission. At little cost you will soon find yourself exerting considerably more control and with more finishing options. Here, Gordon Ryan takes an Ollie to from a brutal arm bar into a still more brutal triangle variation that makes escape very unlikely and allows him to choose his next attack in a leisurely fashion. Next time you are in arm bar position, play around with transitions to triangle variations - front, side, rear and reverse - and see what kind of havoc you can create üòú
"
"When attacking the legs - try to control all three joints: One of the reasons I favor leg lock attacks is because of the very robust connection you can make to an opponents body that makes it rather difficult for an opponent to pull away from you once the attack is launched. This is particularly true when you are able to connect to all three joints of the leg - hip, knee and ankle. You have a choice as which of those joints you seek to connect to first. Sometimes it‚Äôs good to begin with the heel/ankle (end of the lever). Sometimes knee and hip is good (keeps the opponents knee inside your knee line). But at some point, if resistance is strong and there is a danger of the opponent pulling completely away from you, it‚Äôs wise to find a strong connection to all three joints. Here, one hand controls the ankle, the other the knee and my feet and knees control the hip. Once the control has been established - then you can transition to submission - in this case it will require a movement to get my wrist under the heel - but it will be made considerably easier due to that initial three aspect control. The leg is a long and strong limb - maximize your chances with this principle of control.
"
"Reflections on the mounted position: The founders of Jiu jitsu conceived the mounted position as a platform for striking with fists and elbows in a fighting/self defense context. In this context the basic mounted position is devastating all by itself. However, when strikes are prohibited in grappling, it‚Äôs loses much of its bite. In grappling, the mounted position only really becomes dangerous again when you can move from the basic mount into other variations of the mounted position that facilitate submissions, in particular, variations that get either get your opponents arm extended up and over his head or that get you high up on opponents chest and perpendicular to your opponent. When you can transition from basic mount to mount variations - THEN the mount regains its bite and becomes dangerous even in a pure grappling context. Next time you‚Äôre mounted in grappling training - play around with high mounts and getting angles - don‚Äôt be satisfied with just getting mounted - that‚Äôs fine when you‚Äôre allowed to strike, but for submissions you‚Äôll need the other variations to make your mount dangerous
"
"Those critical last few minutes of class: Most people associate the most important part of the class is the sparring section. There is a lot of truth to that - sparring is the single best way to translate knowledge into skill by a landslide. Others will say it‚Äôs the drilling section - that is a definitely a fair assertion - drills impart knowledge and provide a valuable first step in converting that knowledge into skill in ways that can make a vast difference in your performance.  A few will say it‚Äôs the warm up because this provides some level of conditioning and helps reduce injuries that can disrupt progress. There is definitely truth to all those claims. One part of the class that gets no attention but which I strongly emphasize is the post workout review/discussion. This is where we sit down and puzzle out the problems we ran into during the main sparring session. The immense value of this is that IT SETS UP TOMORROWS WORKOUT. Remember that real progress never comes from any one workout - BUT ONLY FROM LONG STRINGS OF WORKOUTS WOVEN TOGETHER THAT BUILD UPON EACH OTHER INCREMENTALLY OVER TIME. By finishing with a resolution of outstanding problems today you set yourself up for improved performance tomorrow - and that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs all about. So take a few minutes at the end of class every now and then to problem solve in ways that make today‚Äôs frustration into tomorrow‚Äôs breakthrough - and watch your progress quicken
"
"Details and direction: Jiu jitsu is absolutely a detail oriented sport. Moves that are performed 90% correctly will fail when used against someone your own level. Adherence to Small details is very often the difference between gold medal and empty hands at the end of a competition. Nonetheless, you must recognize that progress is not only about accumulating details on moves. You must have those details ENCASED IN A GENERAL SENSE OF DIRECTION. You must always have a sense of purpose when you play Jiu jitsu - the details are the means of exhibiting that sense of purpose/direction. In truth you can only remember so many details under stress. Better to have a smaller number of highly relevant details shrouded in a strong sense of direction than endless numbers of details that you can barely remember. For example, in guard passing. A general sense of purpose is conveyed by a principle ‚Äúseek to create pressure by moving side to side  and favor passing to the side opposite the direction your opponents knees are pointing‚Äù and this can give you a broad sense of purpose. Then you can fill in the details of exactly how best to do this with details of grip, body positioning, stance etc etc. So yes - accumulate details over time and do your best to remember them all, but remember that they will serve you much better when they are subsumed under broad guidelines that give you the big picture of what you ought to on the macro level while the details guide you on the micro level
"
"The other side of guard passing: The single biggest aspect of the Jiu jitsu positional game is the struggle of the top player to get past his opponents guard (legs) vs the bottom players struggle to get to guard and retain it. It‚Äôs probably fair to say that that is three quarters of the positional game in Jiu jitsu. When it comes to guard passing, we get taught initially to think mostly in terms of passing guard into side pins. This is good thinking since it accounts for the vast majority of passing outcomes at beginner level. However, as you get higher in the sport and the level of guard play and retention of your opponents rises, in MANY situations (perhaps even most) you won‚Äôt be passing to side pins so much as getting defensive reactions from opponents performed expressly to PREVENT you getting to a side pin that expose their BACK to you. The score won‚Äôt come from passing to side, but rather scrambling to your opponents back and taking rear mount. In a competitive match the bottom athlete will never willingly concede a side pin and the three points - he will instead turn to his knees - this will always create momentary back exposure. If your mind is only thinking in terms of side pins, you won‚Äôt react to the new opportunity. WHEN ENGAGED IN A HEATED PASSING BATTLE AGAINST A TOUGH AND SKILLED OPPONENT YOU MUST BE THINKING ABOUT TAKING THE BACK AS MUCH AS THE SIDE. That way when that half second of back exposure occurs you will pounce on the opportunity without hesitation and score. Here Oliver Taza does a good job exposing Gordon Ryan‚Äôs back during guard drills - the chance won‚Äôt be there long against an opponent of this caliber - having your mind set in that direction from the beginning lessens the time needed to see an opportunity and pull the trigger!

"
"Your best move is only as good as your ability to get yourself in a position to apply it: When most people think of their best move they think in terms of how good they are at EXECUTING the move. That certainly is in important, but that won‚Äôt help you at all if you can never get to the starting position for the move. In practice is is at least as important to be able to steer the action towards your favorite move. START your study with execution - but make sure you COMPLETE it with set ups and ability to maneuver your opponent INTO the move
"
"Integration of offense and defense: Jiu jitsu and fighting in general is always divided into OFFENSIVE and DEFENSIVE skills. This is a useful division when you begin learning as it enables you to focus on a given skill domain. However, as you game matures let‚Äôs be clear - your ultimate level in the game will not be measured so much by your skills in offense and defense but rather by your ability to INTEGRATE offensive and defensive skills. The final steps of the offense/defense dichotomy is to break down the barrier between them and see that ALL GOOD OFFENSE HAS DEFENSE BUILT INTO IT, AND ALL GOOD DEFENSE  HAS OFFENSE BUILT INTO IT. Your long term goal is to bring them together to the greatest degree possible at all times.
"
"Pressure before submission: One of the great maxims of Jiu jitsu is ‚Äúposition before submission.‚Äù There is a lot of wisdom in that phrase. Understand however, that if you add pressure to position you will double the effect and create situations where opponents MENTALLY accept submission BEFORE you PHYSICALLY apply it. Remember that submission is a CHOICE. Many more people will make that choice when subjected to unrelenting pressure prior to the application of the finishing hold. When you get position, go the extra step and start applying physical pressure from there and you will be surprised to see opponents looking forward to the submission hold as it gives them an acceptable out from the unpleasant experience of PRESSURE OVER TIME.
"
"Tie ‚Äòem up with ya legs and attack ‚Äòem with ya hands: Sometimes a simple insight counts for a lot in combat. The great American General Patton once described his strategy as ‚Äúhold them by the nose and punch them in the face.‚Äù It was a numerous throwaway line to describe a massive military operation, but the lesson is there - give people a simple path to follow and in the chaos of a match it will guide them like a lighthouse to the destination they seek. One of the best in Jiu jitsu is to use your legs to tie up your opponent and then use hands to help finish the job. Closed guard, ashi garami, mount and rear mount all involve connecting with your legs to an opponent. Then you‚Äôll use your hands and arms to further isolate your targets and finish. Perhaps best all the leg connections to immobilize an opponent are variations of the triangle. These really put an opponent under pressure because of the immediate submission threat. Train yourself to follow this simple idea as early as you can in your jiu jitsu journey. Avoid the natural beginners mistake of trying to tie up and immobilize opponents with your ARMS - you won‚Äôt make much progress that way. Do it with your LEGS and in particular with the TRIANGLE and your progress will be much swifter
"
"Hunting legs from bottom position: When I began studying leg locks many years ago in the early 2000‚Äôs, they were seen almost entirely as an attack from top position against an opponents guard. Essentially they were seen as an alternative to guard passing when on top. Indeed, the main criticism of leg locks in those days was that if they failed, you would lose top position. When I began studying them, it soon became apparent that there were MANY ways to enter from bottom position. This immediately destroyed the old criticism that if you attempted them you would lose position - if you started on bottom there was no issue with ending on bottom. Furthermore, there were good reasons to FAVOR bottom entries into leg locks. The top athlete uses his legs as his primary base of support. This means any time he is taken off balance, he must spread his feet/knees wider to stay on top - and every time he does this he surrenders inside position to your feet or knees - the precursor of ashi garami variations leading to leg locks. There is more. When in top position the legs not only provide your BASE, they also bear your WEIGHT. As a result, it is more difficult to move them defensively (as opposed to the bottom player where his legs bear zero weight and thus can be moved very rapidly to evade top leg lock attacks). Heavy legs spread wide apart for base are easy targets for leg lock attacks. Time soon showed that the bottom leg lock game was even better than top leg lock game - it fit very well into the smaller athletes arsenal. It is very difficult to fully sweep a skilled opponent, but quite easy to simply disturb their balance - and that‚Äôs all that is required for a sharp leg lock attack. Nowadays the leg lock game has changed greatly from those early days. The vast majority of attacks now are done FROM guard position - not AGAINST guard position. Leg locks now don‚Äôt have to be opposed to the traditional positional game - they can be a part of it by greatly adding to the submission arsenal of the basis of the bottom positional game - guard position. Here, Garry Tonon works for another of his entries into ashi garami from open guard.
"
"You only really control the pin when you control the elbows: Getting to a dominant pinning position in Jiu jitsu is a great thing - it scores more points than any other action if you can get to mount and rear mount. Understand however, that real dominance in top position pins comes not just from the position (in no gi) but the combination of the position AND control of your opponents elbows in ways that prevent him turning into escapes and setting up finishing holds so that you translate position into submission. Next time you are working your way into side of mounted pins - go the extra distance and start looking to control your opponents elbows as well. The more you can elevate and separate his elbows from his torso the more control you will have over the pin and the more likely that pin will turn into a submission hold.
"
"Whatever the other fellow wants - do the opposite: Jiu jitsu can seem like a very complex game at times, but in some ways it is very simple. It is a classic zero-sum game; what ever is good for one player is by definition bad for the other. If you know what the other guy need in order to perform a given move, you can do pretty damn well by doing the opposite of what he needs. That‚Äôs why learning how to attack with a given move often educates you very well in how to defend it, and learning to defend it often makes you better at attacking with it. Whenever you drill a given move, get a feel of what the three main mechanical requirements for its success are - that will give a good insight into what you must do to stop it being used successfully against you in the future.
"
"The example of Georges St Pierre: I have had the honor of coaching many truly outstanding athletes of more than two decades. None surpassed the incredible achievements of Mr St Pierre. Everyone knows his achievements - far fewer know what it was like to train with him in the gym - yet a brief discussion of this could be very beneficial to your own progress. The first thing to note was that Mr St Pierre was fully capable of beating the crap out of any of us any time he felt like it, but he came in to the gym only to play our game of grappling rather than fighting. He knew that grappling expertise was an important part of fighting expertise and would not try to use any of his great advantages in standing grappling and striking (or even mention them) but instead play our submission game. He would almost always pull guard and start of positions of disadvantage to remove his advantages and work on his weaknesses. His only goal was improvement in the area we were best suited to help it. If he wanted to he could have simply disengaged and stalled to avoid our strengths. He never did. He went directly into our strengths and tried to improve his performance in those areas. He did the same thing in every boxing, Muay Thai and wrestling workout i ever saw him do. Every workout must have seemed a nightmare as it was him playing against the best people in the world in their strongest area, on their terms. If someone followed him around for a year and watched his workouts they might see him struggling the whole time - until it was fight night. Then they would see the result of all that work against specialists in their domain. Now it was time to put it all together in HIS domain - the cage - under MMA rules - and you all know how that went! DON‚ÄôT FOCUS IN WINNING IN THE GYM - FOCUS ON IMPROVEMENT AND SKILL ACQUISITION - worry about WINNING when it counts - when you learn to divide those two concerns your progress will be astounding
"
"Intensity: The sport of Jiu jitsu is ideally a mix of mostly relaxed efficiency mixed with spurts of ultra high intensity at the moments where either a big score or a submission is being attempted. Learning to guard when to be relaxed and when to go hard is a huge part of your development. Remember always to put a cap on your intensity - both in terms of HOW OFTEN you go into maximum intensity level and HOW LONG you stay there. Mistakes with either will quickly get you exhausted and unable to go into overdrive when you really need it. The first skill you learn is to monitor your OPPONENT, but as you go further will find that it is just as important to monitor YOURSELF so that you do not get exhausted before you attain victory
"
"Changing angle changes everything: Whenever you are in engaged against a skilled opponent he will adopt a stance that is designed to shut down your ability to attack him FROM YOUR CURRENT POSITION. However, if you CHANGE your current position by taking an ANGLE on your opponent, that stance will no longer be as effective at stopping your attacks. Changing your angle relative to your opponent changes things considerably and makes possible what was impossible just a second before. Make a habit of moving to a new angle prior to attacking and you‚Äôll soon find that you are breaking through defenses that were previously shutting you out.

"Jiu jitsu takedowns: When you look at takedowns in jiu jitsu you see several things. First, the general execution is generally at a lower level than grappling arts that focus primarily on takedowns such as Judo and Wrestling. This is probably due to the simple fact that historically takedowns have been under emphasized in training due to the fact that they score relatively low in a sport who primary emphasis is pins that enable striking on the ground and submission holds. In addition, Jiu jitsu athletes have the option of sitting to guard if they feel their opponent has superiority in takedowns, this always de incentivizes takedown training, since the better you get, the more like your opponent will simply sit to guard and render all your takedown training null and void. I am confident that a change of training culture will in time improve dramatically the execution of takedowns in jiu jitsu as athletes begin to realize it is a very effective to score and ensure top position. Secondly, very often a takedown will be performed that would definitely score under wrestling or judo rules, but which scores zero points in Jiu jitsu. This is the more important difference as this has nothing to do with culture and is the result of the rules of the sport. The scoring criteria of jiu jitsu are always based on POSITIONAL CONTROL rather than the takedown itself. As such, it is the AFTERMATH of the takedown that counts, rather than the actual takedown. You have to be able to satisfy control criteria for three seconds after the takedown. This is difficult to do against a skilled opponent. As such, the art of takedowns in jiu jitsu has a focus on what happens immediately after a takedown. Most grappling styles award points for the takedown itself, and the more amplitude in the takedown, the greater the score. Jiu jitsu does not reward amplitude, only control after the takedown. This creates a need for a significantly different approach for takedowns, where typically the takedown itself will look like it is borrowed from wrestling or judo, but the scoring aftermath looks like a jiu jitsu positional scramble. This is the insight you must carry into your standing training.

"The pressure of the first mistake: Gordon had a fascinating exhibition match last night in Austin Texas against talented MMA star Philip Rowe. Since it was an exhibition match there was not winner or loser - it was designed to give an interesting spectacle to fans who haven‚Äôt seen Mr Ryan onstage since his stomach issues deteriorated. The rule set allowed for as many submissions as possible in a given time (in this case fifteen minutes) so it had the feeling of a gym sparring session. This has a very positive effect in some ways because you get a second chance if you make a mistake and get caught in a submission hold - you just tap and start again. It‚Äôs important to understand that in championship matches the outcome is usually decided by WHOEVER MAKES THE FIRST MISTAKE OR WHOEVER MAKES THE LEAST MISTAKES. This is what makes championship matches so nerve wracking - mistakes are severely punished. The result is that athletes play a very conservative game built mostly around AVOIDING ERRORS rather than taking exciting risks. When athletes are given multiple chances to atone for an error they can open up a lot more and take risks. Last nights match reflected this with both men going for a full range of moves some of which they probably wouldn‚Äôt ordinarily use in a high stakes match. To be sure I believe there is not substitute for conventional rule sets for championship matches - the need to avoid making errors and to capitalize on an opponents errors is what creates the intense drama of big matches, but I do like the more laid back multiple chance rule set for exhibition matches where there is a bigger than usual discrepancy in skill level - it seemed to work well last night and could provide a fascinating alternative for spectators

"Victory In Dallas!! Gordon Ryan and Nicholas Meregali both had extremely impressive wins here tonight in the second biggest grappling event of the year. Mr Meregali showed the fruits of his hard work training without the gi. In just five months he has made great progress and he showed that tonight with a win showcasing his developing standing skills and pressure top game. He hit two beautiful uchi mata takedowns and passed to mount and rear mount multiple times. Gordon Ryan had a tense tactical match with his great rival Felipe Pena and was able to use a combination of guard pulls into reversals and takedowns to secure top position and play a disciplined pace that drains even the best. This match was essentially a meeting of the two best submission artists in the world under a rule set where one of them had to submit. The pressure over time that Mr Ryan can build us very daunting to face and on several occasions Mr Pena seemed to want to stop but then resumed. Just past the forty minute mark Mr Pena asked to stop with a verbal submission and victory went to Mr Ryan. It was an indication of just how far Mr Ryan has progressed that he was able to determine the pace, direction and outcome of the match against such a great opponent who had defeated him at the onset of his career. It was a brave and admirable gesture for Mr Pena to compete tonight - he lost a dear friend in Leandro Lo today and still came to do his best. Now it‚Äôs back to Austin to get everyone ready for ADCC 2022! Thank you to Garry Tonon and Luke Griffith for their help preparing and cornering the athletes tonight. Thank you all for your interest and support for our athletes. Wishing you all the best from Dallas!

"Today we had the honor of working alongside one of the greatest athletes in the history of the sport - the great  Rodolfo Viera @rodolfovieira89 This man was a truly dominant force in both gi and no gi Jiu jitsu - winning both ADCC gold and multiple times IBJJF World Championships. It wasn‚Äôt just his record that made him a legend, it was the way he won that captured everyone‚Äôs attention - he was a peerless pressure fighter who could crush any guard and then work through his inescapable pins to submission. Now his primary focus is MMA but he kindly worked with the squad today in grappling and showed everyone he still has his skills! In addition to being a great athlete, he is also a real gentleman - it‚Äôs a true honor to have him here for a week
"
"When your opponents goes to initiate movement you‚Äôve got two choices - either try to STOP the movement or GO WITH the movement. Both approaches are very effective - which one you choose in a given case will depend on the circumstances of that case - which one you choose in general will be determined by your body type and personality. One is not better than the other, but they do amount to very different expressions of Jiu jitsu. Garry Tonon was a master of FOLLOWING an opponents movement - Gordon Ryan was a master of STOPPING an opponents movement. Which do you generally prefer?
"
"The ideal of classical Jiu jitsu is to use your legs to fight your opponents upper body: One of the defining elements in the sport of Jiu jitsu it is the heavy emphasis it puts on using the LEGS as the primary means of connection and control of an opponents body. The mount, knee on belly and rear mount are the only pins that score in Jiu jitsu - and they all use the legs to connect to opponents upper body. The guard is the only acceptable bottom position and it uses the legs to connect to opponent. In top position the whole game is to prevent an opponent connecting to you with his legs because of how dangerous that can be. The best submissions holds either use the legs directly (triangles, arm bar) to control and finish opponents or indirectly to anchor you to an opponent (rear strangle etc). If you‚Äôre doing most of your work with your hand and arms - YOU ARE DOING IT WRONG. Make sure every time you train you make the mental association between your legs and your opponent. Make sure the bulk of the workload is done by your legs. Be sure to emphasize training your legs for flexibility and strength over everything else. Your legs are the key to greatness in this game
"
"Isolation: The most impressive displays of strength from the human body all involve the unity of the body working as a whole, arms, legs and core moving with unity of purpose. Our bodies are strong when they are unified. When it comes time to play the game of Jiu jitsu you want to reduce your opponents strength to the greatest degree possible. The best way to do this is to isolate his limbs. A single limb in isolation is not  strong. THE ESSENCE OF JIU JITSU IS TO MATCH THE UNIFIED STRENGTH OF YOUR WHOLE BODY AGAINST THE ISOLATED WEAKNESS OF AN OPPONENTS SINGLE LIMB - whether it be leg, arm or neck. If you can do this you can make a strong man weak and easy to control.
"
"The most fundamental forms of control over the human body will always be control over the HIPS and the HEAD. Interestingly, in most cases you have to choose one or the other (there are some powerful exceptions). In most cases of top positional control, we start with the hips and progress to the head, since the hips are typically closer. Make a deep study of hip control and head control and your game will improve greatly
"
"Identify the problem: Every submission hold has an escape. Every escape involves a set of movements - but invariably there is ONE movement that does the majority of the work of escape. For example in upper body submission holds from guard involving your legs such as triangle, juji gatame arm bar, omoplata etc - most of the early escapes are postural escapes involving your opponents HEAD rising away from you to create distance and this is the core of the escape/defense overall. Once you understand this as the athlete trying to perform the submission it‚Äôs all a matter of building increasingly powerful HEAD CONTROL as the basis of your submission game from guard. Focus upon the most pressing problem pays big dividends in Jiu jitsu. In a word of ten thousand problems learning to focus on the biggest ones first makes a big difference to your performance. Under stress it‚Äôs much easier to solve one bigger problem than a dozen smaller ones simultaneously. Develop a clear idea of what the biggest threat to your success is and attack that threat relentlessly - you will soon notice the difference in your performance

"Homeward bound: At Austin airport waiting for my plane for the long haul to Australia to see Mom (Mum) and family. It‚Äôs been a long time! Looking forward also to seeing jiu jitsu friends old and new and doing my best to help out the burgeoning Australian jiu jitsu scene! One day when I get some time I will go the land where I was raised, New Zealand - I miss the beauty of that great Island where I grew up. This will be a thirty hour flight when all is said and done - I hope I‚Äôve still got what it takes to hit the ground running üòÇüòÇüòÇ More likely I will have to be dragged off the plane unconscious and mumbling incoherently about grappling moves üòÇüòÇüòÇ See you there!

"On the road to Houston: Driving in to Houston for the big WNO show tomorrow night featuring Gordon Ryan vs Brazilian powerhouse Patrick Gaudio - one of the few men to give Gordon a very tough match in the past. Just got informed they weighed in within a few pounds of each other - sounds like it‚Äôs going to be another battle! There is also some excellent tour ya room at welterweight and lightweight along with some very interesting female match ups - looking forward to this show and seeing downtown Houston again!
"
"When you have dangerous submission holds - even the ones that don‚Äôt fully work will have an impact on your opponent: A big part of how your opponent behaves towards you in a match is how DANGEROUS he perceives you to be. If he doesn‚Äôt see you as dangerous at all, he will do whatever he wants with no fear of consequences. However, if you have sharp submissions he will recognize that if he ever lets you go too far on a lock, the match is over. As a result, he will be much more circumspect in his approach to the match. If lock on a tight submission hold on a opponent that takes him within a hairbreadth of tapping but he just manages to slip out - I guarantee you the next time he approaches it will be in a cautious manner. It is important that you be able to carry a threat into a match that your opponent recognizes and respects - this will funnel his actions in other directions and allow you to control the direction of the ensuing action. In this way the THREAT of submissions is almost as important in match outcomes as the their actual successful APPLICATION. Here, Garry Tonon puts the powerful Rousimar Palhares under great pressure with a very strong heel hook attack - it was very close - but not completed - but it had a significant impact on the match as it meant Mr Tonon could initiate all the subsequent leg attacks for the rest of the match and force Mr Palhares in other directions (mostly takedowns). Don‚Äôt be discouraged by submissions that almost worked but didn‚Äôt - THEY WILL STILL HAVE AN EFFECT IN YOUR FAVOR THAT YOU CAN EXPLOIT ON THE PATH TO VICTORY
"
"Teaching: Most of what I write about is about your goal of LEARNING Jiu jitsu. However, a big part of my approach to learning is getting my students involved in TEACHING. There is a great relationship between the acts of learning and teaching and as you progress in one you will inevitably improve at the other. I often get my students to teach moves back to me in class or to teach some innovation they have figured out. The act of teaching forces you to figure out the most important details and features of a technique. Asking yourself how to present the information makes you understand the technique more clearly. Presenting it in a way that is understandable for all levels makes you prioritize the most pertinent details. Obviously it‚Äôs easier to teach to others when you‚Äôve reached a higher level in the sport, but start early. Start by teaching friends at the same level as you some aspect of the game you have researched and try it out together. Make adjustments in accordance with the problems you encounter. Just the act of asking the important questions and understanding the central problems involved around the technique can enhance your understanding. It works wonders for my students both as athletes and as teachers themselves. Teaching is a skill like any other, and, like any skill, the best people are usually those who start early and do it often. I started teaching when I was a blue belt in the late 1990‚Äôs. Nothing makes me happier as a teacher than seeing my students breakdown complex material and improve the understanding and knowledge of those who train around them. It makes everyone in the room part of a project and gives a whole new meaning to their training. Try it. Start small with friends and see how it can benefit your game.
"
"Defensive soundness before submission: The great cliche of Jiu jitsu is ‚Äúposition before submission‚Äù However, in some situations such as ashi garami, conventional approaches to position don‚Äôt really apply, since both athletes are in a situation where they can attack each other at the same time. I‚Äôm these types of scenarios ‚Äúposition before submission ‚Äú gets replaced by ‚Äúdefensive soundness before submission.‚Äù The idea is to set your feet, knees and other relevant body parts in locations where they are defensively sound (not open to obvious attacks) prior to launching your own attacks. In this way you avoid the undesirable situation of both athletes attacking simultaneously, in which case victory will go to the faster athlete or the one who is prepared to lose a limb to break his opponents limb. The best way is always that of first making yourself defensively sound so that when you do attack you can do so without the distraction of simultaneous counter attacks. Don‚Äôt get into submission shoot outs if you can avoid them. Rather, create situations where you can fire at will without return fire. Focus on defensive soundness first, attacks second
"
"Kimura - the joker in the pack: All the various submission holds have their own distinct character. Kimura often has a similarity to the knight on a chessboard. It can be used in ways that are very different from the other chess pieces. It has its own character that breaks the usual patterns and rules. Kimura can be used even from disadvantageous positions, from strange angles and entry points, from standing as well as ground, in combination with other holds, as both a submission hold and a means of control, it can be performed with your arms (the standard method) but also with your legs for additional power. It is often derided as a strong man‚Äôs move, but in fact if you can get an opponents hand behind his back, or incorporate your legs into the move, it takes no more strength than any other. Along with the guillotine/front head lock and ashi garami it is the most commonly available submission hold. A common problem for most students when they first begin using it is that they will get the grip and then attempt the move and if it does not work immediately - abandon it. This is understandable as many kimura attempts can be strongly countered by a skilled opponent if you hang on too long. However, part of kimura mastery is learning when to hold on and when to let go. To learn this you have to hang on for a while. You‚Äôll make some mistakes initially and put yourself in arm bars and other counters when grappling good opponents - that‚Äôs part of the learning process - but in time you‚Äôll learn how to move and counter those counters and come out with a win via kimura. It all begins with time spent with the lock in place
"
"Keep your knees between you and your opponent: The essence of bottom position in Jiu jitsu is to use your legs as a barrier between you and your opponent. This is what enables smaller, weaker people to wear down and defeat bigger, stronger people - for the legs of a small person are stronger than the arms of a bigger person. Your first instinct in this game when underneath opponents must always be to get your feet knees and hips between you and the other guy. Whenever you‚Äôre in trouble - retract your knees to chest and face your opponent!
"
"Surprise: of all the elements that can make for a successful entry into a move - surprise may be the best. There is a reason why sucker punches are the preferred weapon of street thugs - unexpected blows are always the most devastating. So too with jiu jitsu - if you can achieve a degree of surprise the likelihood of you getting a breakthrough are much greater. There is a problem however - how can you possibly achieve a degree of surprise in a sport where everyone knows all the main moves? Good question - you won‚Äôt surprise opponents with your MOVES - you‚Äôll surprise them with the SET UPS. Try always to create an indirect approach to moves where you make an opponent believe you are going for one thing and attack with another. THE BETTER YOUR OPPONENTS DEFENSIVE AWARENESS THE MORE YOU WILL NEED TO ATTACK WITH AN INDIRECT APPROACH. Next time you‚Äôre sparring make an effort to perform a pseudo move prior to your real move. Divide your attack into false first movement and a second real movement - this is how you can preserve surprise in a world where most of the options are already known to both parties
"
"Submission goals: Your arsenal of submissions is a big part of defining your overall game. Which ones you choose to be your main weapons is up to you - but what is NOT up to you is the areas your submissions must cover. You must have at least one lower body joint lock, one upper body joint lock and one strangle from front and one strangle from back and one (either lock or strangle) that you can do from a scramble situation. This is is your minimum requirement. Again, you get to choose which ones you adopt, but there‚Äôs no choice in application areas - you HAVE to be competent in all these!
"
"Know thyself: Knowing what you‚Äôre good at is a key to victory; knowing what you‚Äôre not good at is a key to avoiding defeat. Knowing both is the key to continual progress over time in the training room. Accurately evaluating yourself is not easy - we know ourselves mostly through the words of others rather than self analysis but remember that others are usually either indifferent or have their own agenda when evaluating you. Learn to judge yourself through results rather than words - it‚Äôs always more honest.
"
"Start at the extremities and work to the core: The best control of the human body is at the hips and head - if you control both of those then you truly control your opponent. The problem is that the head and hips are difficult to get a hold of. This means that the typical pattern of Jiu jitsu is to initiate contact at the extremities - the feet and hands - and work methodically up the limbs to the hips or head. It‚Äôs rather like climbing a tree or a rope - you have to climb to get to your goal. Get used to this type of action - it will form the basis of every engagement you make in the sport

"Jiu jitsu all stars team Moldolfo on fire in Kazakstan! The jiu jitsu super team assembled by ADCC Head @mojassim80 showed the power of modern jiu jitsu in a grappling event @aiga.global They took on two teams - one featuring mostly Asian and Oceania  jiu jitsu representatives and the other from Dagestan training out of Khabib Nurmomegedov MMA. New Wave athletes Giancarlo Bodoni and Luke Griffith racked up impressive submission victories as did many of the other athletes in a very dominant performance! Tomorrow they face another team from Dagestan Universal Fighters. Here Luke Griffith shows the power of his back control into a mandible strangle
"
"Can you remember the first submission you ever successfully applied in sparring? One of the first great memories in your jiu jitsu life is the first time you successfully applied a submission hold on a sparring partner. Submissions are among the more difficult moves of the sport. A lot of prerequisites have to be satisfied before they happen. Usually we succeed with positional moves like passing guard or getting mounted before we successfully apply a submission - positional movements generally don‚Äôt require as many complex movements and controls and so come more naturally to most students. My first successful submission was an utterly atrocious headlock lift and squeeze that overwhelmed my equally inexperienced white belt opponent only because I was bigger and stronger. My first real submission was an arm bar (juji gatame) from guard. When my partner tapped I couldn‚Äôt believe it had worked! A real submission applied from underneath! Success breeds success and I went hunting for guard position and arm bar attacks from there every chance I got. Then when I finally landed a successful kimura from guard, I started chasing kimura incessantly. What was your first big submission breakthrough? Did it go on to become your favorite move? (At least for a while). Why do you think it was that move in particular that worked early for you? Was it because your coach heavily emphasized it? Or perhaps because it was well suited to your body type? Or was it just random? Sometimes it‚Äôs useful to ask these questions to know yourself better and make assessments as to what you should work on in the future!
"
"When you control the head‚Ä¶An old cliche in grappling is that if you control the whole body. There is a LOT of truth to this. Learning to exploit the value of this insight is a big part of your progress in Jiu jitsu. It has many manifestations. One of the most important for grappling is the use of the triangle not in its usual sense as a stranglehold, but rather as a means of immobilizing the head so that joint locks become more powerful. A fine example of this is Kimura. It can be very difficult to finish a Kimura when your opponents head is free to move around. When you begin in a triangle that immobilizes the head and THEN apply a Kimura the results can be devastating. The same goes for armbars, even American locks and wrist locks. Much of the defense to these moves involves a preliminary movement of the head - when that is taken away the locks become far more difficult to escape and more devastating in their effects. Next time your triangle isn‚Äôt working so we‚Äôll as a strangle - use it to attack with joint locks - I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll be impressed with the results!
"
"Four vs two: One of the primary motivations to use open guard positions is that you can fight with four of your limbs while your opponent can only use two against you. He gets two (weaker) limbs along with the mobility advantage of being on his feet and the weight/pressure of gravity as his weapons. You as the guard player get four limbs (including the two strongest). This is the essential nature of the battle. You have different weapons but both are excellent - you have to learn how to use those different weapons to advantage. Learning to see the difference and use it to your advantage is a key part of winning the eternal battle between guard vs guard passer.
"
"Gaining prior advantage: Jiu jitsu is founded upon the principle of advantage - WHENEVER POSSIBLE: PRIOR TO LAUNCHING AN ATTACK - BEGIN BY GAINING SOME FORM OF PRIOR ADVANTAGE THAT MAKES THAT ATTACK MORE LIKELY TO SUCCEED. There are many forms of prior advantage - you can break an  opponents balance, break his stance, distract him, surprise him - the list is long. One of the best when it comes to sweeps and takedowns is to create an advantage by having your two legs on the ground to provide base, mobility and drive while you take one of your opponents legs off the ground so that he has substantially less base, mobility and drive than you do. This makes the chance of a successfully completed sweep or takedown far higher than you fight in an equal footing. Whichever method you select, begin by seeking prior advantage of some type any time you can - it always makes your task a little easier
"
"Mechanical perfection: Chasing perfection in technique is a path to both heaven and hell. The closer you get, the better your performance. It can come at a heavy price however, the desire for perfection can paralyze action when athletes keep waiting for that perfect opportunity for the perfect technique that just never arrives, or hold back from trying a move for fear that it won‚Äôt be perfect. Make sure the chase for perfection plays a positive role in your development rather than a negative one. Relentlessly pursue ideal form in drilling and do your best to replicate that sense of perfection in sparring and competition, but temper this with the understanding that it doesn‚Äôt need to be perfect - just better than your opponents ability to defend it - so don‚Äôt hang back when the time comes - go into the technique with confidence!
"
"Turtle breakdowns: The main concern of turtle breakdowns (attacking the turtle position in order to gain points and/or to gain some kind of advantage that leads to submission) is quite different in Jiu jitsu than in other grappling arts. In Judo and wrestling the idea of any turtle breakdown is usually done with the idea of forcing the opponents BACK TO THE FLOOR in order to pin his back to the mat. In Jiu Jitsu this scores nothing. The central focus in Jiu jitsu is generally towards GETTING TO THE REAR MOUNT POSITION. This scores the maximum possible in the sport - four points. As such, it makes sense to make your primary focus in Jiu jitsu training for breaking down an opponents turtle position geared towards getting your hooks in a advancing to rear mount. This will satisfy both the demand for scoring points (you get the maximum score) and for submission (you end up in the position that allows you to use the most high percentage submission method in the sport - rear strangles. There are other good ways to attack a turtle position that have their merits, but getting to rear mount should be your primary focus. The central problem you will have to overcome will always be the connection of your opponents elbow and knee, which serves as an obstacle to your ability to insert your hooks and score. Here, Gordon Ryan looks to break that connection and open space for his legs to enter and get into his favorite finishing position. When it comes time to train your turtle breakdown skills, out the majority of your time into those methods that take you to rear mount - no other methods are so well suited to the unique nature and points system of Jiu Jitsu
"
"Victory in Austin! Team New Wave won five out of five matches tonight here in Austin at the finale of the Whose Next grappling reality show hosted by @flograppling Big Dan Manasoiu began the action with a submission win over a very tough Tristan Overvig from the Daisy Fresh team. Then Mike Rakeshan, one of the most popular characters from the show, defeated Sewer Rat via Kesa Gatame asphyxiation. Giancarlo Bodoni won a unanimous decision against the extremely talented B Team standout Jay Rodriguez in the most exciting bout of the evening with both athletes showing brilliant attack and defense. Nicholas Meregali then defeated world champion Breylor Grout via submission with a beautifully executed Kata Gatame strangle after a splendid display of positional dominance that showed his development in no gi jiu jitsu. Then main event Gordon Ryan stepped up to take on the current heavyweight WNO champion and the man who has dominated no gi heavyweight competition the last twelve months, Pedro Merinho. Mr Ryan was determined to show the power of his pinning game which he did in fine style - taking an athlete of the level of Pedro Merinho who is very difficult to control and sticking him to the mat is very difficult indeed, but Mr Ryan did it for fifteen uninterrupted minutes whilst maintaining a draining asphyxiation that wears down even the toughest opponents. With five minutes left he decided to end the match with his characteristic back strangle. Five out of five wins - four out of five submissions - these guys are talented! I hope you all enjoyed the show!! Thank you as always to @roka for giving us the training facility that makes it possible to prepare for these events
"
"Stopping an opponents move doesn‚Äôt end the story - it STARTS the story: too often athletes will do good work stopping an opponents move and then subconsciously fall into mode of thinking whereby they think they‚Äôve done enough and settle into neutral position. Don‚Äôt congratulate yourself for stopping a move - that‚Äôs exactly when some of the greatest attacking opportunities arise - that‚Äôs when things start to get interesting. Remember - the basis of your opponents defense is always his STANCE. At the moment you‚Äôve stopped his move his stance will be temporarily broken, making offense MUCH easier. That‚Äôs why you should see the act of stopping an opponents move not merely as a successful defense, but also as one of the best possible times to launch into offense. When an opponent‚Äôs stance is compromised - and it almost always will be after a stopped attack - that‚Äôs when the chances of a successful attack are highest since there is so much less to have to fight through to complete your counterattack. So turn your mind in the direction of attack every time you stop an opponent‚Äôs attacking move - you‚Äôll be pleasantly surprised how much easier attacks become
"
"So often our natural inclination is to turn and run from danger - but in Jiu Jitsu it is very often the case that you do better by moving in towards danger and seek to nullify it rather than fleeing into an even worse predicament.
"
"Chasing perfection: Giancarlo Bodoni in his first match at ADCC 2022 as time runs out he is decisively ahead on points and chasing the finish - another few seconds and it would have happened. His reaction afterwards speaks volumes - he wasn‚Äôt happy with what was a dominant performance against a very tough world champion opponent. Then he went out and finished all his remaining opponents including the defending ADCC champion with a mix of strangles and leg locks. It‚Äôs that elusive pursuit of perfection and creating a culture of high standards that creates great performers. Don‚Äôt settle for anything less. Even when you come up short you‚Äôll do better than you ever would by settling for lowered standards. You will rise to the level of your goals. If you set the bar low, you‚Äôll inevitably perform at a low level. If you set it high, you‚Äôll run into a lot of frustration and disappointment at times, but when triumphs come your way, they‚Äôll truly be something memorable
"
"One day far out in the future you will have to face the biggest Jiu jitsu challenge of your life. You don‚Äôt know who it will be and you don‚Äôt know when it will be - but one thing you DO know is that your best chance at victory will always be to start here and now with the best PREPARATION you can. In a world of uncertainty that‚Äôs something you can be sure of.
"
"You can do it! One of the most common questions I am asked is whether you can come back from injury and perform well in Jiu jitsu. It‚Äôs natural to doubt your ability to come back from a major setback. Around February 2nd 2019 Gordon Ryan fought a tough match against the great Jo√£o Gabriel Rocha. About halfway through the match he completely tore his LCL off the bone  He was able to hold on and win a very close match but the damage was done. He was scheduled for reconstructive surgery and told that it would probably be a year until he was back to normal. This was tragic news as 2019 was a n ADCC World Championship year - missing the worlds would be a terrible blow to any elite grappler. Initially he could not train at all. The only form of training was mental knowledge training. He would come to class and simply watch from the sidelines to keep his mind in the game. This went in for months. Early tests showed he was regaining linear mobility quite well,  but the kind of inward and outward joint mobility required for Jiu jitsu just wasn‚Äôt there. Finally he got cleared for light training. The early sessions were not very encouraging. He was a late to every move and often I could see him struggling to perform even basic moves. There are few things more frustrating to a Jiu Jitsu player than knowing what you are supposed to do, but being physically incapable of doing it. Eight weeks out from ADCC I fully assumed he would not be going to the World Championships - he just wasn‚Äôt at that level. I was planning the team performance around the other athletes and was assuming Gordon would be a useful training partner for the competitors but not competing himself. One day Mr Ryan came in and had a very good workout. He performed several of his favorite moves very well. Next day he looked even better. By the end of the week he was beating everyone in the gym. At four weeks he repeatedly and easily finished a famous visiting athlete - it was obvious - he was back in the game. Four weeks later he went to give one of the greatest performances in ADCC history - there will never be a shortage of people counting you out - just make sure you yourself are never one of them.

"Who‚Äôs controlling who? When you look at this picture it seems on the surface that the top athlete is in control. After all, he has passed my guard and is in a side pin. But I am under both his arms. It will therefore be easy to move underneath his body weight and escape before the pin registers. This is an important point. What‚Äôs more important - the position or the grip? In many cases the grip is extremely important, in some cases arguably more important than the position. The position is only as useful as the control it offers and if your grip is inadequate to exert control over an opponents movement it‚Äôs not very useful at all. Next time you‚Äôre about to get pinned focus on getting your arms into a grip that negates the value of the pin and you‚Äôll see that the pin isn‚Äôt nearly so fear inducing as it would otherwise be. In particular focus on getting both your arms under your opponents as under hooks and you‚Äôll discover that as long as your movement is not constrained (and it won‚Äôt be if you have double under hooks under a side pin) then you‚Äôre not really pinned at all. Remember that it‚Äôs the pin and and a controlling grip TOGETHER that is a problem, not just the basic position by itself without a proper grip to solidify it.

"Fate has a way of f**king with us üòÇüòÇ: Nicholas Meregali won his first world absolute title this weekend in California, but the victory did not come easily - in training just thirteen days before the competition Mr Meregali badly tore his rib cartilage - a notoriously painful and debilitating injury. There isn‚Äôt much one can do about a rib injury and so he had to go in with his movement severely compromised and do his best. When the brackets were announced We were stunned to see that his first opponent in the open weight tournament is literally the largest active black belt competitor in the world! A man somewhere between three and four hundred pounds!!! I‚Äôm thinking to myself as I read the brackets ARE YOU F**KING KIDDING ME? Nicholas comes in with a busted ribcage and his very first opponent is the biggest and heaviest man in the sport??!!! How the hell did the gods of fate arrange that?! And why do they hate us this much?! üòÇüòÇüòÇ What were the chances of this happening? üòÇüòÇüòÇ As always there is nothing to do but shrug your shoulders, laugh and keep going üòÇüòÇüòÇ Fortunately that‚Äôs exactly what Mr Meregali did and he went on to win with his trademark loop strangle late in the match! It‚Äôs something I often tell my students - when you go to compete - always cover the worst case scenario because the gods of fate have a way of making it happen every time! üòÇüòÇüòÇ I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve all had similar experiences in both jiu jitsu and everyday life - there‚Äôs not much you can do except work on our skills so much that even when that worst case scenario gets thrown at you you have such an over abundance of the relevant skills that you can still overcome the challenge - and that exactly what Mr Meregali did!

"
"Breaking rules: There are many general rules that we usually observe in Jiu jitsu ‚Äúdon‚Äôt turn away from an opponent,‚Äù is a common one you hear. Understand always that general rules are usually ABBREVIATIONS of important information - it has to be this way because they are designed to hold as much information in the fewest words. As such, they have exceptions built into them once a little more  wordage and information is added. In the case of ‚Äúdon‚Äôt turn away from an opponent‚Äù what is really being expressed here is ‚Äúdon‚Äôt turn away from from an opponent in ways that expose your back.‚Äù Once you realize there are ways to turn away from an opponent that DON‚ÄôT expose your back, then you will immediately see it‚Äôs ok to turn away provided you take some precautions. Here, Garry Tonon has turned away, but he has used a posting stiff arm to prevent an opponent getting chest to back contact and lifted his shoulders off the mat so that the back exposure will be momentary rather than prolonged. As such, there is very little danger of dangerous back exposure and thus it is fine to turn away in this case. The general heuristic rules are of immense value because they pack a lot of information into short, easily remembered packages - but realize that every simplification has its limits and exceptions - sometimes those exceptions can be of great value to your performance!

"I am very pleased to announce the release of my latest instructional video - NEW WAVE MOUNTED PIN ATTACKS. In this video I look in detail at no gi mounted position and show exactly how my students first control opponents, then shut down their ability to escape, then attack their ability to breath and then finish them with refined versions of the most high percentage finishes from the mounted position. Gaining confidence in the mounted position without the GI can be a tough journey. Without a collar to stabilize you and set up strangles and arm bars it can feel like riding a barrel down a river when you‚Äôre perched atop an strongly bridging and twisting opponent. Yet the potential rewards are huge. It‚Äôs no coincidence that the two greatest grapplers of all time, Roger Gracie and Gordon Ryan, both favored the mount above all other top pins. If you want to know how to get the most out of this position and use it to dominate your toughest rivals and training partners check it out! Link in my Instagram Bio

"Conversion: People ask me all the time what characteristics the best athletes I work with or see exhibit - here‚Äôs one that rarely gets mentioned - CONVERSION SKILLS - the ability to take a position with promise and potential to score and convert it into an actual score. It‚Äôs a lot like golf - the spectators are wowed by the impressive looking fairway drives and long shots; but in reality it‚Äôs the boring action of putting that distinguishes the champions from the guys you‚Äôve never heard of.  Learning to convert positions that have potential - top turtle position or side control for example - into actual scoring positions such as mount and rear mount - is one of the characteristics of the best player. If they have a chance to score, they almost always convert it successfully into points. It‚Äôs not the most exciting part of the sport, but it‚Äôs one of the most important to become a consistent winner.

"Mats, memories and meetings: I began teaching introduction classes under my sensei Renzo Gracie. As senior instructors left to create their own schools my teaching responsibilities grew. In 2001 MMA was a fringe sport trying to recover from a time when it was banned from television and decried as violent expression of ‚Äúhuman cock fighting.‚Äù Often we would watch MMA from Japan where it was an accepted sport. One day In early 2001 was teaching private classes when a crew of Japanese athletes came in to train at Renzo‚Äôs. They were doing grappling based MMA training rather than Jiu jitsu. I recognized the main athlete as Caol Uno, a highly ranked athlete of that era who always fought with courage and skill and often survived terrible predicaments in his fights to come back to victory. Mr Uno was in America for his bout with early MMA icon, Jens Pulver. He did a long and arduous workout and was suffering thirst. I went to front desk and got him some bottles of water and gave them to him. We didn‚Äôt speak each other‚Äôs language but his genuine sense of thanks was impressive. Almost twenty years later I was teaching a seminar with the squad in Singapore. After showing a technique i looked for my water bottle when Caol Uno came out of nowhere and offered me a bottle of water!! He was in the gym training for another fight in a few days - history repeating itself after two decades!! Once again lack of language didn‚Äôt stop the feeling of heartfelt thanks - this time going in the opposite direction! This sport is amazing. Just a brief connection on the mats can form a bond that lasts far beyond what you‚Äôd expect! The best part was trying to explain to Nicky Ryan who Caol Uno was - Nicky was not even born at the time the first meeting happened!!

"This is a game where the addition of a single relevant detail can take your performance of a given move from mediocre to highly effective in a short time frame - so study hard! Many people are willing to work very hard physically but shy away from mental study. Hard physical work is great but much better when complimented by hard thinking about how to improve performance through more refined technique.
"
"Symmetry: do you need to be able to perform your major moves on both sides of your body with equal skill? This is a question I‚Äôm often asked. The human body itself is asymmetrical. Almost everyone is either right handed or left handed and we heavily favor one side. Your jiu jitsu will inevitably reflect this fundamental fact. Most great champions are considerably better at performing their favorite moves on one side than the other. Indeed, I would go further and say that in most cases it‚Äôs better for most people to focus mostly on their preferred side for their major offensive moves so that they can get the training volume to create a truly strong move that will be effective at championship level. I‚Äôd rather have a world beating right hand Guillotine and no left hand Guillotine than an average Guillotine on both sides. In some cases, especially defensive moves, you might need symmetry. For example a side elbow escape. You never know which side of the body your opponent will pin you so shouldn‚Äôt you be equally good on both sides? Even here I would argue that side symmetry is required but that move symmetry is not required. For example, after my hip replacement I still had an acceptable right side elbow escape but my left side elbow escape dropped to truly feeble levels. However, I compensated by switching focus to left side high leg escape which I could still perform at adequate levels of competence. In this way I was symmetrical in the POSITION , but not with MOVES. This is the most natural and effective way for most athletes to develop over time.

"Great night of grappling in Austin: Tonight the regional grappling show FIGHT TO WIN came to Austin and put on another great show at the Sheraton Hotel. Emerging athletes Giancarlo Bodoni and Luke Griffith had outstanding performances against very tough opponents with Mr Bodoni winning with a finely applied heel hook and Mr Griffith via rear strangle - both athletes sat to guard early but used wrestling reversals from bottom to get up into top position and create the pressure needed to get their submission victories. It‚Äôs a great chance for developing athletes to get stage experience and showcase their skills in front of an audience. Thank you to Garry Tonon and Gordon Ryan for fine cornering and coaching work. Back to the gym tomorrow to keep working on those skills!
"
"Victory in Austen!! Craig Jones had a fantastic back and forth match tonight with the exceptionally talented Tye Ruotolo at WNO Grappling event tonight here in Austin. Mr Jones was able to show a whole new side to his game that he has been developing with a very fine display of takedowns, takedowns into leg locks, guard passing, submission defense and top pressure to take a unanimous decision over a very game Mr Ruotolo who never gave up and fought well until the end. It was great to see Craig Jones use the aspects of his game that he uses daily in the gym but has not used in matches. Oliver Taza also competed tonight against the young phenom Mica Galvao. It was a tough physical match and Mr Galvao showed his developing brilliance to win a strong decision - he will be a great force in Jiu jitsu in the future. Hope you all enjoyed the show! Now it‚Äôs back to Puerto Rico to get ready for the next big challenge! Wishing you all the best from Austin!!

"I am very happy to announce the launch today of my latest instructional video series FEET TO FLOOR Volume 2. The emphasis of Volume 1 was on getting students with little standing experience to a level where they could takedown opponents their own size and skill level in the shortest possible time frame. This was done by focusing on the crucial preliminary skills that make all the other standing skills possible - stance, motion, grip, off balancing and position. Then we looked at the takedowns that most people find the fastest to acquire skills in - the hand dominant takedowns suck as collar drags, ankle picks, single legs, double legs etc along with a section on takedowns for self defense. This time we look at the longer term skill of takedowns that are foot/leg dominant along with the takedowns that I believe are the best suited overall for most Jiu jitsu purposes - the sacrifice takedowns (sutemi waza) such as Tomoe nage, sumi gaeshi and uki waza. These combine extreme effectiveness with great tactical safety and have a lot of cross over with skills that Jiu jitsu athletes are already very familiar with in ground training - so they are relatively easy for most students to learn. The big theme of the video is to get you all thinking like a boxer - just as a good boxer sees the jab as his most important punch - not because of its hitting effect, but because of its ability to harass, distract, confuse an opponent in ways that set up the powerful following punches - so too, a good grappler uses his feet to sweep, trip and off balance an opponent to harass, stumble and confuse an opponent to set up the big follow up throws - in this case, Tomoe nage, sumi gaeshi and uki waza (bit also any other throws you favor) If you want to make your feet your jab and set up power throws perfectly  suited to JiuJitsu and get some highlight reel scores - take a look üòú There is a link in my Instagram bio

"I am very happy to announce the release today of the final volume of the GO FURTHER FASTER Jiu jitsu fundamentals series STRANGLES AND TURTLE BREAKDOWNS. I cover the 3x3 gi strangles system in which the three most high percentage gi strangles in the sport are applied in the three most important strangle scenarios to give you the match winning details and tactics that you will use every time you step on the mats in your Jiu jitsu career. There are a vast number of strangles in the gi, many are interesting and exotic, but Almost Ninety percent of the successful strangles in top level gi competition come from just three families of strangle - my recommendation is to focus the vast majority of your study and training on them. To paraphrase - ‚Äúfear not the man who knows thousands of strangles - fear the man who knows the three best strangles and has practiced them thousands of times and knows every aspect of their successful application.‚Äù I also cover the closely related skill of turtle breakdowns, which obviously sets up many of the best strangle opportunities. If you are interested in boosting your performance with gi strangles and breaking down the toughest turtle defenses - check it out! I will post a link in my Instagram bio Know more - win more!
"
"Small persistent movements often garner bigger rewards than big single movements: When we want to perform a move we usually think that the bigger and more dramatic our movements the more likely we will get into the positions we seek. Sometimes that is true, but usually what you‚Äôll find is that a smaller moment performed five times gets you further than a big Herculean movement performed once - and it has the additional benefit of usually being less tiring. Here I want to get an angle on a training partner as we go into toreando passing. Rather than taking one giant step to get an angle that evokes an equally big defensive reaction from an opponent, I take a series of small shuffles that add up to a big movement without putting an opponent on high alert or tiring myself. Try working with repetitive smaller movements in place of big single movements - you might be surprised how effective they can be
"
"Approach as every match and every scenario within a match as A PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED rather than as an ORDEAL TO BE OVERCOME. Your problem solving ability is among the most important elements in attaining victory - arguably the most important. Courage, tenacity, will, strength, resilience and all the other attributes and virtues are wonderful things - but when there is a door to be opened, hammering, kicking, smashing and ramming may do it, nothing does it so well and so easily as a key. Your ability to apply knowledge and figure out solutions is the key to every lock. Put your emphasis on that above all else.
"
"Victory in Houston!! Gordon Ryan put on a grappling clinic against the great Brazilian champion Patrick Guadio here in Houston in the main event of WNO Grappling Event tonight. Once again he called the method victory - arm bar (juji gatame) - an incredible feat against such a powerful opponent. Along the way he showcased his pressure passing style and pin transitions/control that make him such a difficult opponent to stop. Also tonight there were three very impressive title matches. Brazilian superstars Mica Galvao and Baby Shark had great wins against very talented opponents and Elisabeth Clay defeated Brianna St Marie in an extremely tightly contested match to win her title. Another great night for grappling - I hope you all enjoyed the show!!
"
"Control begins with grip - if you control an opponents hands, wrists or elbows he will find it very difficult to grip you whilst you have grips on him. If you can get that initial advantage it helps steer the rest of the engagement in your favor. Make a serious study of your initial contact. Don‚Äôt just grip for the sake of gripping. Grip with a purpose and a direction. Get control of his hands, wrist or elbows whilst denying him the same and you‚Äôll always be off to a good start.
"
"Strangling from the back with or without collars/lapels: When you‚Äôre training or competing in a gi and you‚Äôve done a good job getting behind your opponent and it‚Äôs time to end it - I‚Äôm sometimes asked - is it ok to strangle with your arms the same way you would in a no gi match and forsake the collars? It‚Äôs not wrong to use naked strangles when using a gi, you‚Äôll see it done occasionally even at high levels, but it‚Äôs not optimal. Collar strangles by their very nature are inherently more efficient than even the best naked strangles. The collar is the perfect strangle implement. It is like using a purpose designed tool to complete a task rather than an improvised tool - they‚Äôll both do the job, but one does the job much better. Train yourself to use the gi when strangling. It will enable you to incorporate bodyweight and leg strength into your rear strangles - a big advantage over naked strangles. In addition the collar penetrates the opponent‚Äôs defensive jaw positioning far better than your forearm ever could. It‚Äôs there - it‚Äôs better - use it.
"
"The impossible goal of seeking perfection in Jiu jitsu performance is a fine metaphor for our lives in general. We all know we will stumble often and come up short at the end, but just as no matter how fast we ran as children, the rainbow always stayed well ahead of us, that didn‚Äôt make it any less alluring or captivating; so to on the mats. Whatever happened in your day, vexations, frustrations and disappointments, every training session is a chance to forget it all for a time and chase that impossible but fascinating goal. Keep yearning and keep learning, you‚Äôll never be perfect but you can perfectly imperfect.
"
"Watching jiu jitsu: Every day you train there will be some amount of time where you will be watching other people spar. If you‚Äôre injured and can‚Äôt train you can spend the whole session observing other people spar. If you can‚Äôt even get to the gym you can watch video of great athletes in competition. There are clearly many opportunities for you to watch jiu jitsu on a regular basis. The question becomes - what will be the manner in which you watch. Most people watch jiu jitsu with a recreational mindset - the main thing they watch is the RESULT of a sparring or competition match. They watch to see who wins. While this does have entertainment value, it does not improve your jiu jitsu. Instead, watch with a questioning mindset. Instead of focusing on the result - FOCUS ON THE FACTORS THAT DETERMINE THE RESULT. Many of these factors are very subtle and not easy to observe when you start, but be persistent, victory in jiu jitsu becomes mostly from a relatively small set of moves. There are patterns of success in this game - THE MORE YOU WATCH THE MORE YOU‚ÄôLL SEE THOSE PATTERNS - and the more you SEE the patterns of success, the more you‚Äôll be able to REPLICATE the patterns of success for yourself.
"
"Get to the end of the lever: This entire game is a complex web of applied mechanical and biomechanical insights bound within strategy and tactics - and foremost among those mechanical insights will always be lever and fulcrum. When a given move has its basis in the principle of lever and fulcrum - MAKE SURE YOU WORK AT THE END OF THE LEVER - don‚Äôt settle for the first grip you get - adjust until you are working with the most leverage possible - it makes a real difference. Here, outstanding teenage phenom Helena Crevar @helenajiujitsugirl does a fine job of getting to the end of the lever and the result? Another great win!
"
"Alignment and misalignment: The human body relies on good alignment to produce whatever strength it is capable of. When you watch champion Olympic weightlifters put up their mind boggling lifts you can see the near perfect alignment of their bodies throughout the lift is what enables them to put up weights that would crush the rest of us. In Jiu jitsu too we need alignment when we want to be strong and efficient. Good posture makes the moves of Jiu jitsu easy. The flip side of this is that when we attack an opponent - THE ATTACK MUST ALWAYS BE AN ATTACK ON THE OPPONENTS POSTURE. If you can put your opponent into a forced, unnatural, contorted position, he will find it very difficult to defend himself. Look at how Garry Tonon is not satisfied with just getting a guillotine - he goes the extra distance and rotates his opponents head into an unnatural position that weakens the opponents ability to defend the strangle. With the spine misaligned it‚Äôs very difficult to even begin an effective defense, let alone complete it. Whenever possible look to take your opponents body out of alignment to double the effectiveness of your attacks!
"
"Head control: There is a reason why they classify us as vertebrates - our spines are the center of our body. On top of that spine is our head. The spine is the longest lever in the human body. The head is at the end of that lever. If you control the head you can exert tremendous leverage that can be used to control the whole body. Look for opportunities to control the head - many are pretty obvious but some are more subtle. Understand that you can exert pressure on the head in both linear (eg snap down) and circular (eg crossface) directions - be sure to use both. Understanding Jiu jitsu is to a large degree, understanding the human body and its essential nature. Our spines largely define our physical lives - make sure your Jiu jitsu reflects this fundamental fact
"
"Failure: We all have an internal voice that tell us whether or not a given move that we attempt during sparring or competition has succeeded or failed. When you compete against opponents your own size and skill level, the great majority of your attempted moves will fail. So that voice in your head will be saying ‚Äúyou failed‚Äù very often. When we experience failure it‚Äôs natural to feel frustration and disappointment. This usually has the effect of lowering our morale over time until you stop attempting moves because they simply aren‚Äôt succeeding. You must not slide into this way of thinking. Understand this - A SUCCESSION OF FAILED MOVES PAVES THE WAY FOR A SUCCESSFUL MOVE - why? Because every act of resistance is a drain on your opponents energy levels. As long as you are not expending more energy than your opponent over time, a series of failures will create a tired and fatigued opponent who will eventually be unable to defend the next move. One failed move doesn‚Äôt do anything, a but a long succession of failed moves can degrade an opponents energy levels to a point where success is inevitable. As long as you keep this view in your mind, the many inevitable failures you will experience in the course of a hard match won‚Äôt get you dispirited - on the contrary - they will inspire you to keep pushing. Skilled opponents can stop almost any move when they‚Äôre fresh, but even the most skilled opponent can‚Äôt stop a move in a state of total exhaustion. Victory never came from a single failure, but many victories came from multiple failures over time that kept an opponent working to exhaustion until he couldn‚Äôt stop the next move
"
"Layers of defense: When an opponent goes on the attack his offense will achieve a certain depth - sometimes it‚Äôs a rather superficial attack that you can stop early before it gets too far. Other times it‚Äôs a powerful attack that tests the depth of your defense. Many athletes defend the initial lines of defense well - but the best athletes can defend well all the way to the last lines of defense and stop an attack even at a point where most would have given up and conceded a score or even a submission. Arrange your defense in layers. Categorize your defenses in terms of early, middle and late stage and pay them equal attention. Don‚Äôt be satisfied with saying ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt let my opponent get me in that position‚Äù or ‚Äúdon‚Äôt get there in the first place.‚Äù Rest assured - a good opponent WILL get you into bad positions and you better have a more effective response than these cliches. Put yourself in critical late stage defense regularly under light pressure and try to work your way out, increasing pressure as your skills rise. The ideal is to have equally robust defense from the first line of defense to the last!
"
"If you want to feel stronger than your opponent - fight his head, arms and shoulders with your feet, legs and hips - that is the surest way to make strong opponents feel weaker and average opponents feel weak.
"
"When the pressure is on: How many moves do you REALLY know? We all think we have a good idea of the size of our skill set. In truth however, the only time you find out is when you play under pressure. ONLY THE MOVES YOU WILL USE WITHOUT HESITATION IN THE BIGGEST MATCH OF YOUR LIFE ARE YOUR TRULY KNOWN BY YOU - everything else can be considered only as moves you are familiar with, but not truly known. Your job is to slowly build upon that small set in two ways. First, refining still further the moves already there. Second, adding a few new ones every year to a level where you would pull the trigger with them without hesitation in a high pressure match against your toughest rivals with everything on the line. In championship training this is the acid test to see how big your skill set really is.
"
"Distinguished visitors: We had the honor of training today with the great Satoshi Ishii, Olympic Gold Medalist and All Japan Judo champion. It was very impressive watching a truly elite Judoka work with the modern jiu jitsu style. His Judo pedigree showed today. He has a tremendous inside trip (ouchi gari) and body drop (tai otoshi) and osoto gari. Like every elite Japanese judo player I‚Äôve seen he has excellent positional ground grappling (ne waza) that even a good jiu jitsu player would be proud of. I always loved watching his judo battles against the two great Japanese Olympic champions Kosei Inoue and Kejii Suzuki back in the day - watching his jiu jitsu battles today were just as good!
"
"Hold ‚Äòem by the nose and punch ‚Äòem in the face: Those words were famously said by General Patton to describe the idea of devastating aggression - if an opponent can‚Äôt move while you‚Äôre hitting him - you are twice as threatening to him as usual. So too in grappling. Getting your body into position to attack someone is never easy. It becomes a lot easier if you can hold them in place somehow first, and then swing the rest of your body into a devastating attacking position. We aren‚Äôt allowed to hold opponents by the nose in Jiu jitsu (I‚Äôm very grateful for that because I‚Äôve got a big nose so I‚Äôd really be in trouble! üòÇüòú) but we can hold them in place with something even better - Kimura - and then bring the rest of our body into the attack, usually with triangles, arm bars, back attacks and leg attacks. Here, Craig Jones uses a very well applied Kimura grip to immobilize an opponent so that he can swing his legs into attacking position - he now has the full choice of his favorite weapons - triangles, arm bars, back attacks - or going downstairs for the legs. So, Hold ‚Äòem by the arm and (no - no punches in the nose) and attack them with your legs!
"
"Contrasts: Look at this picture and you see a very strong contrast in application of strength. Georges St Pierre is a close to maximal tension while alongside him Gordon Ryan is at minimal tension. Both are in good position - why the contrast? Mr St Pierre is beginning the application of a submission hold, Mr Ryan is simply maintaining a position. The game of Jiu jitsu requires us to work with extremes of physical tension from very high to very low. As a general rule, you want to keep your body tension as low as possible to get the job done and recognize that some jobs require a considerable amount of tension for short periods of time. So for example, submission holds, guard passes, sweeps and takedowns will require short burst of massive physical tension and output when you go to complete them. Understand that you can only maintain that level of intensity for short bursts - don‚Äôt stay above the redline too long and exhaust yourself. This game is characterized by LONG PERIODS OF RELATIVE CALM INTERSPERSED WITH SHORT BURSTS OF EXTREME EXERTION. If you break this pattern by being too relaxed all the time you won‚Äôt have sufficient energy to finish moves and score. If you break it by maintaining tension too long you will exhaust yourself and lose to your own fatigue. Keep this behavioral pattern of tension and relaxation in mind as you train every day and you will last longer and break through more
"
"Daylight: When you enter into the various holds and pins of jiu jitsu the quality of your execution will de determined largely by the quality of your connection to your opponent. IF YOU CAN SEE DAYLIGHT BETWEEN THE RELEVANT PARTS OF YOUR BODY TO HIS, FAILURE WILL FIND ITS WAY TO YOU OFTEN. Seek always to contour your body into the contours of your opponents so that just as water takes on whatever form it‚Äôs container takes, so to you adapt to the form of your opponents body - leaving no space for escape. To do this you will need a degree of relaxation and softness to your body, not too much or you‚Äôll be ineffective, but enough to let you mold into your opponent - and if you can do this, you‚Äôll have satisfied one of the most important prerequisites for success in the application of Jiu jitsu moves
"
"Beginnings - stance, distance, grip: Every grappling exchange has a beginning. How well you do overall is often affected by how that beginning goes. It‚Äôs important you get a decent start. How decent that start is is determined by your STANCE, your ability to control DISTANCE and your ability to get a good working GRIP. Every time you engage with an opponent you should have an internal memorandum running through your head - stance, distance, grip. Failures in any one of these three prerequisites will inevitably cause problems as the action continues. There are a thousand things to take care of in a long jiu jitsu exchange - but make sure you take care of first things first - stance, distance and grip
"
"Fighting bigger opponents: Jiu jitsu is one of the few combat sports that still allows open weight competition where smaller athletes can be matched against much larger opponents. In addition, in daily training at the dojo we are routinely matched with larger training partners. Whenever faced against someone bigger and stronger than yourself I always advise - GET BEHIND THEM TO STRANGLE OR ATTACK THEIR LEGS. These two approaches to victory have proven more successful in my experience watching my students over quarter of a century than all others. There are other good methods - I think the guillotine works well against bigger opponents, but nothing has had the level of success of back strangles and ashi garami based leg attacks. The back makes good sense. A big opponent can‚Äôt crush you with his weight when you‚Äôre behind him and strangles can be applied even on very big people. An opponent can use simple strength to push or pull someone behind him. In the case of leg locks, most people are inherently less coordinated with their feet and often more careless and forgetful of foot/leg placement than they are of hand/arm placement. The most incredible athlete I ever worked with regards competition against bigger opponents was Garry Tonon - he took on some absolute monsters and emerged victorious almost every time by emphasizing this strategy of constantly attacking back and legs. Here he is on the way to winning another EBI title at 205 pounds - incredible given that he was the 155 pound champion ( as well as every other weight division between!). When it‚Äôs time to take on the big fellas, think about BACK and LEGS as your path to victory!
"
"Precision: The more precise you are with your mechanics the more effective your moves will be when applied with whatever strength you have. However, we have to be realistic. The more stress and chaos we are subject to in sparring and competition the harder it will be to maintain the ideal of perfect mechanics. Don‚Äôt despair. You don‚Äôt have to be perfect in application - just good enough to get the job done. Your goal in drilling is to get as close to perfection as you can. Your goal in sparring is to be good enough to get the result you seek. The more precise you are in drilling, the more there will be a carryover effect into your sparring that increases your precision; but be realistic, it‚Äôll never be a perfect, pretty and refined as drilling so don‚Äôt be upset if your game feels a little messy and klutzy compared with your drills.
"
"Let the position do the work for you: It‚Äôs natural in combat sports to  feel like you have to work and hustle the whole time to beat tough opponents. There certainly will be many times in a tough match where you indeed need to work very hard and hustle to stay ahead - but there will be just as many times where you ought to slow down your work rate and relax a little. This will enable you to recharge after a physically demanding period of action and add greatly to your endurance. One of the best time to do this is after you have scored in a dominant position - the two best are mount and rear mount with side pins also very good (I would not recommend this from knee on belly pins however). In these cases - let the pin do the work for you for a while. The onus is on the OTHER guy to work hard to escape - not you. As you relax and recharge, he is under great stress - if you  can Maintain this state of affairs for a minute or two you will have a big energy advantage over the opponent. Watch how Nicky Ryan rewards himself first the hard work of taking an opponent down and passing his guard to mount with a little siesta time that will soon create a situation where is recharged and the opponent exhausted - and then the job of finishing will be so much easier.
"
"Take away your opponents ability to resist one step at a time: The game of Jiu jitsu is all about first degrading your opponents offensive abilities (by taking him to the ground and securing top position either by takedown or sweep and then getting past his legs into dominant upper body pins) and then degrading his defensive abilities. A key part of this second aim is to pin your opponents arms down so that he has to defend himself with only one arm (and in some cases - no arms). This truly has an impact on an opponents ability to defend himself. It‚Äôs hard enough to defend a bad position at the best of times, when one of your arms is trapped it‚Äôs even worse. Once you‚Äôve taken away an opponents offensive ability - train yourself to to go further and undermine his defensive abilities. Understand that this usually means some kind of trapping of his arm(s). It doesn‚Äôt take much to do this - but it adds a LOT to your ability to slice through the toughest defenses and get a submission victory!
"
"If you want to ruin your opponents day - nothing beats a high pressure pin: A big part of grappling is fatiguing an opponent over time. There are many good ways to do it, one of the very best will always be to get to strong upper body pins with chest to chest contact. This puts the onus on your opponent to recover his position against your positioning and body weight and set in the context of further threat of you advancing to another pin and increasing your score. This creates a lot of physical and mental stress for an opponent and allows you to cook him over time. Learning to read your opponents fatigue level is important. It‚Äôs easy from a pin due to the close proximity. Once you ascertain that he is starting to tire - start increasing the pressure. You can do it mechanically with methods such as cross facing and you can do it tactically with threats of submission and transitions to other pins. Learn to use the inherent power of pinning to develop your skill in INDUCING EXHAUSTION - a skill that you must master to beat your toughest opponents!
"
"Different speeds: One of the clearest differentiators between novice and expert in Jiu jitsu is the ability of experts to VARY THE SPEED AND INTENSITY of the game at will to match their purpose. Most beginners have only one speed - maximum. They quickly find this is exhausting and if you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre doing, just gets you into bad position slightly faster than if you slowed down a little. One of the first signs of progress is the ability to slow their pace down to a speed that enables them to make considered choices and solve problems. Over time they will learn to play at many different speeds and to vary their speed many times over the course of the match. Here, Nicholas Meregali shows his mastery of speed variations with a relaxed pace just moments before he stepped out to win a tough match at the recent IBJJF World Championships. He went effortlessly from this relaxed pace to a full intensity competition match at the highest level without interruption. This kind of mastery of variation of pace and intensity is at the core of Jiu jitsu mastery. Just as modern cars benefit from having many more gears than old fashioned cars to create smoother and more efficient power, so too you will benefit from having many jiu jitsu gears to suit the many situations you will find yourself in.

"New instructional video release! I am very happy to announce the release of the latest installment of the NEW WAVE JIU JITSU series SUBMISSION ESCAPES. This video focuses on an area that my students are well known for - escape from seemingly impossible submissions that would finish most people. In EBI Overtime time competition my students would regularly escape from world champion opponents in very little time even when taking on much larger and more experienced opponents. This gives you great confidence and also sets up your ability to immediately counter attack - one of the major themes of this video - so that you greatly improve the interface between your defensive game and your offense. This will enable you to keep the offensive initiative even against dangerous attacking opponents - a key part of my philosophy of Jiu Jitsu. Check it out if it sounds interesting to you üòúüòú Link in Instagram bio

"Negate first - attack second: Jiu jitsu can be a very scrappy game at times - especially when you and your opponent are launching attacks on each other at the same time. It‚Äôs not wrong to do this; it can certainly make for exciting and entertaining matches, but it‚Äôs hard to develop the control and focus needed to score or finish on tough opponents when you are simultaneously attacking each other because you‚Äôre worried about defense at the same time you‚Äôre trying to conceive of offense. Often it‚Äôs a better approach to first shut down an opponents ability to attack you with subtle positioning of your limbs and body before even thinking about your own offense. As your opponents attacks falter, you will be able to slow things down and focus on what you want to do. Here, Gordon Ryan uses good positioning of his legs, arms and head to shut down an opponents guard offense for a brief period so that as the attacks slow down in speed and intensity, he can launch his own passing moves without distractions
"
"Adjustments: In the chaos of a match it‚Äôs actually quite rare that your first positioning for a given move will be correct. Too many athletes get to a given attacking position and immediately attempt to complete it when their positioning is not optimal. The result usually isn‚Äôt good. When you understand that the first entry into the move gets you in the door but doesn‚Äôt represent exactly where you want to be, you‚Äôll take that extra time to make your adjustments and work patiently into better leverage position. It may take a little longer, but the result will be a big increase in effectiveness. Don‚Äôt just enter - enter and adjust - understand that your first attempt usually isn‚Äôt optimal and that just a few small movements can convert it from something that almost works to something that definitely works!
"
"The power of the guillotine: There are a great many moves in Jiu jitsu - too many to master in a lifetime. Of all the moves one of the most valuable is a good guillotine. There are many variations, almost all of them are very good. You don‚Äôt have to master to master them all, but I do earnestly believe that you should master at least one of them. My reasoning is that the guillotine is one of the few moves that can completely turn a match around in just a matter of seconds. It is like the grappling version of a KO punch. You can be losing a whole match, but if you‚Äôve got a strong guillotine you‚Äôve always got a chance as long as there is time on the clock. Here, Giancarlo Bodoni @giancarlobodoni hits a beautifully applied arm in guillotine late in a match against a strong takedown attempt in a recent tournament that he won. Notice how he begins with his feet in an open guard guard position but transitions to both legs around his opponent to increase the power and effect of the strangle. No other submission is more readily available than the guillotine - top, bottom, standing , ground, offense of defense - the possibility is always there somewhere if you look. If you master the move you can take it from possibility to reality
"
"Distance control: Controlling the distance between you and your opponent is among the most important and fundamental skills in all combat sports. It is done very differently from one combat sports to another, depending upon the rules and objectives. In Jiu jitsu it is done primarily through grip, although movement is also very important. From guard bottom position distance control is usually achieved with the collar grip, but in no gi Jiu jitsu you will need other methods. Closed guard is the one we usually start with when beginning Jiu jitsu. Ultimately distance control is the ability to control an opponents ability towards and away from you. Locking your legs around your opponent is a good way to do this. However, you‚Äôll need good methods from open guard too. My favorite is always ashi garami. It fulfills the most important requirement of distance control - it controls movement forward and backwards because you have one leg behind an opponents leg (controls movement backwards) and one in front (controls movement forwards). In addition it allows you to attack your opponents balance and threaten leg locks at all times. In order to have an effective bottom guard game you‚Äôll need an effective means of controlling distance. It doesn‚Äôt matter which you choose, ashi garami, de la riva, reverse de la riva or any other method, just so long as you have at least one good form of connection that controls movement forward and back and sets up attacks.
"
"Pressure: Pressure over time is the single greatest determinant of victory. It is rare to beat someone your own skill level quickly and easily - it can happen - but not often. Usually it will be pressure over time that breaks an opponent to a point where they mentally accept defeat. Don‚Äôt be upset when your moves fail - every attempt creates pressure that drains an opponent - each failure adds up over time and compounds upon the next until a breakthrough is reached and victory will be yours
"
"Self assessment: Every time train in Jiu jitsu we get a very clear idea of how we performed because of the unambiguous nature of sparring. If your partner is better than you they will usually submit you. If your partner is roughly the same level and size it will typically be an exhausting dogfight without clear result. It‚Äôs natural to leave every workout strongly doubting whether you are making any tangible progress. This is because as you rise in skill level EVERYONE AROUND YOU IS RISING AT ROUGHLY THE SAME SPEED AND THEY ARE LEARNING SIMILAR TECHNIQUES AND TACTICS SO THEY KNOW MOST OF YOUR ATTACKS. As such you never really feel like you‚Äôre making forward progress. It‚Äôs natural that you should feel discouraged by this - no one likes to expend large amounts of time and effort without result. Every so often the Jiu jitsu gods will throw a morsel your way. You may be matched against a visitor who doesn‚Äôt know your moves and immediately everything feels easier. You might be matched against someone who used to be much better than you but who took time off or moved away and now in the rematch you suddenly do much better than ever before. You might learn a new move or gain a new insight that allows you to break through against partners you could not do anything to previously. It‚Äôs then that you suddenly realize that despite all your nights of despair and doubt - you HAVE been making progress after all. Don‚Äôt just have faith in Jiu Jitsu - have faith in YOURSELF too. It‚Äôs almost impossible to train hard and long without making decent progress. Be aware that the very nature of communal training will often hide this progress from you - so stay the course and learn to check that part of your mind that tells you that you will be permanently static - you won‚Äôt be. Understand that the path of Jiu jitsu is one of hard work over time where you will often doubt your progress, but where occasional joyful triumphs among a few big failures and a great many average or forgettable sessions will give you hope and direction for the future
"
"What‚Äôs your mindset here? You‚Äôre under attack. A stud opponent has your leg in a vulnerable position and is working intelligently and swiftly towards a finish. How is your mind reacting? The lowest level of reaction is PANIC. The second level of reaction is to scramble into intelligently directed defense and ESCAPE. The third and highest level of reaction is to see the possible of COUNTERATTACK even as you navigate into an escape. TO SEE THE POSSIBILITY OF DEVASTATING COUNTER OFFENSE WHEN EVERYONE ELSE SEES ONLY DEFENSE IS THE MARK OF A SUPERIOR SUBMISSION EXPERT. Train your mind to think this way and you will distinguish yourself from the crowd

"Getting ready: Nicholas Meregali @nicholasmeregali has been showing his immense skills in the gi these last three weeks getting ready for the Pan American Jiu Jitsu tournament this weekend in Orlando Florida. He and @helenajiujitsugirl will both compete this weekend. It‚Äôs been a blast going back into the world of gi training after a long period of no Gi specialization! Good Jiu Jitsu is good jiu Jitsu regardless of whether gi  or no gi - if it embodies the spirit of control that leads to submission it‚Äôs all good!
"
"Positions for less athletic people: A word that gets thrown around a lot in Jiu jitsu bus ‚Äúathleticism.‚Äù No one ever tries to define what they mean by this but generally it refers to the an athletes potential for movement - how fast they can move, what range of motion can they move through, how far they can move via running or jumping and for how long etc etc. In general, movement is aided by space that permits greater freedom of movement. Any kind of physical encumbrances that reduce movement potential is the enemy of athleticism. This provides an important general rule - THE MORE CONNECTION THERE IS BETWEEN YOUR BODY AND YOUR OPPONENTS, THE MORE YOU WILL REDUCE HIS ATHLETICISM. So if you are older, slower, and just plain less athletic than your opponent - you want to maximize connection between your body and his to undermine his athletic advantage. So the best positions for older, slower athletes to work successfully against younger, faster, more explosive, more flexible opponents are those that put the maximum area of your body in contact with his. Arguably the best example of this from bottom position is half guard. This creates very significant connection between the top and bottom player which has a great slowing and holding effect that can be used to undermine faster and more athletic opponents. Next time you feel physically outgunned underneath an opponent, try locking him up in half guard and see if you can take the pace down to a level that works in your favor instead of his
"
"It‚Äôs a game of levers and fulcrums - so when it‚Äôs time to apply force - APPLY IT AT THE END OF THE LEVER AND BE SURE THAT THE FULCRUM IS IDEALLY POSITIONED. When using levers and fulcrums a difference measured in inches can make a substantial difference in force. Take a little extra time to set the fulcrum and find the end of the lever - you can make a substantial improvement in performance in a minute with this simple insight alone

"Active rest: Jiu jitsu, like any combat sport, can be an exhausting experience. Sometimes prolonged periods of exertion, especially when trying complete takedowns, guard passes, guard retention etc gains trough and relentless opponents, can leave you very tired indeed. You can‚Äôt stop when tired - but you can take active rests that can recharge your batteries and get you ready for a next push forward towards victory. Whenever you capture a strong position after a prolonged struggle and you feel you are fatigued to the point where performance will be severely compromised - take a break. Use the position to collect your score and understand that the onus is on your opponent to do something to get out. For a period long enough to physically recover - let the other guy do the work and focus on physical recovery. Now, obviously you don‚Äôt want to simply go limb and have the opponent escape and undo all your hard work. Do the minimum physical expenditure to hold the position and keep the opponent honest by making some kind of minimal threat, in the case of rear mount - threaten a strangle. That takes little energy but can‚Äôt be ignored by an opponent. When you feel you have recovered sufficiently - go back on the attack. You will be pleasantly surprised by how just a little time at lower energy expenditure can enable you to recover and get back to genuine offense. What people call endurance in Jiu jitsu is mostly THE ABILITY TO VARY INTENSITY LEVELS SO THAT SHORT BURSTS OF HIGH ENERGY ARE FOLLOWED BY SHORT REST PERIODS THAT ENABLE YOU TO GO THE DISTANCE AND RETAIN ENERGY FOR A STRONG FINISH.
"
"A solid start makes an easier path to the finish: Jiu jitsu is a lot like life - we always hope for the best but usually have to dig ourselves out of disasters. The good news is that the strong defensive emphasis of jiu jitsu allows us to get out of bad situations in most cases. Nonetheless if you can get off to a good start, it makes the job of control leading to submission considerably easier. The two factors that determine how good or bad your start will be in jiu jitsu are usually DISTANCE and GRIP. As a general rule it‚Äôs easier to control distance from top position. The idea behind distance control in jiu jitsu is to place yourself in a position where you can get to grips with your opponents but he will find it difficult or risky to get to grips with you. You can use this initial advantage of distance to compound your advantage by taking a grip upon your opponent that gives you more control over him than he has over you. Going from one form of advantage (distance) to another (grip) sets a direction where you can try to keep advantage from start to finish - this is an ideal - obviously you won‚Äôt be able to maintain this at all times in every match - but it‚Äôs the ideal we strive for; and that ideal requires a good start. Make DISTANCE and GRIP dominance your first goal when engaging with opponents and the rest of the game will generally run smoother as a consequence
"
"If I asked you what your best grappling attack was I‚Äôm sure you could answer in a second - but if I asked you what your best grappling attack will be next year could you answer so quickly? Don‚Äôt just focus on where you are now - think ahead to where you want to be in the future
"
"Movement creates space: They say never mistake movement for action - there‚Äôs a lot of truth to that - nonetheless there are times in jiu jitsu where movement for the sake of movement can furnish a reward. If you can create movement when you‚Äôre in a bad position then that movement will often create space and misalignment - and that can create the conditions you need to escape. Sometimes it can be very hard to employ escapes when an opponent is locked tight to you - movement can create just enough looseness to perform the escape or at least create an action/reaction sequence that will facilitate escape. You don‚Äôt want to go crazy and dig yourself deeper into trouble with poorly directed movement, but a judiciously applied roll or turn is often just what you need to loosen things up a little prior to your escape
"
"The floor is your friend‚Ä¶but a very fickle one: Top position in Jiu jitsu is built around the idea of BASE. This concerns your ability to build a stable base of support that enables you to stay on top and build pressure over time that breaks opponents will and ability to resist. Using your hands and feet as posts of support is the key to building a good wide base that keeps you stable in top. In this respect the floor is your friend. Post your hands and feet out wide on the floor and you‚Äôll be stable on top of even the wildest opponents. Be aware however, that oftentimes you post a foot, you become vulnerable to leg locks and oftentimes you post a hand you become vulnerable to arm locks. To complicate things further, it‚Äôs not every time, but only certain situations where this is true. The onus is on you to know when it‚Äôs safe to post on the floor and when it‚Äôs not - only then will the floor be a friend and not an enemy. Even if you aren‚Äôt sure whether it‚Äôs safe or not, just the awareness that posting can lead to dangers is enough to make you wary and pull away from danger as it starts to materialize rather than just complacently leave it there and get locked by a skilled opponent. Treat the floor for what it is - a friend when you use it well but one that can betray you when you get complacent
"
"When you‚Äôve got one - you‚Äôve often got another: We tend to think in terms of what‚Äôs right in front of us and get myopic about what‚Äôs further ahead. While it‚Äôs certainly good to be focused on the here and now and try hard to finish the task in front of us - we have to be realistic also - and the reality is that when you‚Äôre matched against someone your own size and skill level most of your initial attacks will fail due to strong resistance. As such, it‚Äôs very important you be able to look past the current attack and see the next possibility. A really good place for you to start training your mind and body this way is with the arm bar juji gatame. Why? Because juji gatame cuts across the upper middle of the human body at an angle that gives you direct access to triangles and ashi garami leg locks as well as the original arm bar - any time you have the position for juji gatame you can thread yourself easily into variations of triangles and ashi garami leg locks (and if you‚Äôre creative you can find other alternatives as well). Spend some time playing around in the juji gatame position - thread your legs into different types of triangles. Reach down for a leg and drop into leg locks - pretty soon you will find yourself habitually looking beyond the first attack into follow up attacks - and that‚Äôs a big part of what will get your beating better opponents in the future
"
"Once a move is properly set - NOW it‚Äôs time to use your strength! People often talk about jiu jitsu as a sport where the application of strength is irrelevant or even bad. This is not realistic. Strength plays a big role in the outcomes of any match where the skill level of the athletes is near parity. What is true is this. Strength applied from bad tactical positions is irrelevant or bad. Strength applied wastefully is bad - but strength applied to finish a move that has been well set is good and greatly increases the chance of success. So if you feel you‚Äôve done a good job of locking a move on tight with good efficient mechanics and sound positioning - don‚Äôt hold back - use whatever strength you have to seal the deal!
"
"Pressure will always reveal your weaknesses: I am often asked by students what they need to work on - the best way to assess what you need to work on is to spar with a partner who can subject you to severe pressure. Just as water poured into a vessel will immediately reveal a leak, and a great weight will immediately reveal a weak link in a chain - so too, pressure will break your game at its weakest point and tell you immediately what you need to work on. I don‚Äôt recommend subjecting yourself too often to great pressure, but it‚Äôs definitely something you need periodically to show you were you need to do the most work for the future.
"
"What‚Äôs the hurry? Submission holds all have their own character. Sometimes speed of application really does help get the breakthrough. Other times a submission hold can be a long process of control and switching from one position, grip or even a different submission altogether. As a general rule - submissions where you position an opponent on their back or butt tend to be the slower paced submissions where it‚Äôs wise to emphasize control first and submission second; whilst submissions performed is rolling on to hands and knees with chest down to floor are usually best performed at a quicker pace - though there are exceptions. The most important thing is this - LEARN TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THOSE SUBMISSIONS THAT OPERATE BEST WITH HIGH PACE EXECUTION AND THISE WITH LOW PACE EXECUTION AND PERFORM THEM AT THE SPEED APPROPRIATE TO THE SITUATION. Understand that pace of execution is an important factor in the success or failure of most submissions and that mixing up speed versus control usually has bad consequences. When slow and steady is appropriate - go slow and steady. When fast and aggressive is appropriate - go in fast and aggressive. PACE is one of the least talked about factors in the application of submission holds but one of the most important for good results. You‚Äôll need to be able to go both fast and slow - and crucially, recognize when you use one and when to use the other

"The inspirational story of Giancarlo Bodoni‚Äôs gold medal debut performance at ADCC 2022 from @flograppling zthis young man uprooted his life from Massachusetts to Austin to come and train with a new and unproven team. His own development was in a crises after a string of defeats in low level No gi competition. He came with no guarantees of success - unknown and unheralded - the only thing he brought with him was a dream. Just twelve months later he won the biggest grappling event in history in one of the most dominant debut performances in ADCC history. This is the story of this man and that year and a truly remarkable transformation - watch and let his story transform you!
"
"Work rate: There are many simultaneous battles going on at any given moment in a jiu jitsu match. One of the most important of all is the battle to control RELATIVE WORK RATE. Both athletes are performing work. The question is - who is performing more mechanical work? Of the two athletes have similar levels of physical conditioning, as time passes, the athlete who is working harder physically will fatigue faster. YOUR JOB IS TO CREATE CONDITIONS WHERE YIUR OPPONENT IS FORCED TO WORK HARDER THAN YOU ARE. If you can do this consistently you will win most of your matches based on this single consideration. The easiest opponent to take down, pass guard, pin and finish are TIRED opponents. They don‚Äôt START tired and they don‚Äôt get tired easily if they are good. They get tired because you make them work harder than you for extended periods of time. There are many ways to do this but the single best one is to make them CARRY YOUR BODYWEIGHT IN COMPROMISED POSITIONS - in particular to carry your weight on their upper body. The longer you can make them do this, the easier will be the task of finishing them.
"
"Advantage: A central theme of Jiu jitsu is this - WHENEVER ENGAGED WITH THE OPPONENT ALWAYS TRY TO GAIN SOME FORM OF PRIOR ADVANTAGE BEFORE LAUNCHING YOUR MAIN ATTACK. The first form of advantage most Jiu Jitsu students learn is POSITIONAL advantage and certainly this is one of the mo important forms of advantage in the sport, but it is far from the only one. Learn to exploit every Avenue of advantage - balance, grip, postural, tactical the list is long. Here, Nicholas Meregali has an opponent hopping on one leg while he is on two, if he can add a balance advantage and a postural advantage the takedown will be inevitable, if not, at least he has gained tactical advantage. Don‚Äôt just attack - get advantage prior to attack - this is the spirit of Jiu jitsu

"Athlete safety in training: As a coach one thing I take very seriously is athlete safety in training. The single most common reason for derailed training programs is serious injury. We are all mature enough to realize that a combat sport that focuses primarily upon breaking limbs and strangling people carries a risk of injury. We also accept that as long as the risk is inside acceptable parameters the benefits of Jiu jitsu skills are absolutely worth whatever the risks of injury are. My question as a coach is always to ask how to keep those parameters acceptable. This week I filmed in conjunction with BJJ Fanatics a video on training safety and how to reduce the risk of severe or catastrophic injury in Jiu jitsu. Periodic minor injuries are all part of the fun of the game - we all accept that - but no one wants to go to hospital or worse, send a friend to the hospital with an injury that was entirely avoidable. I am going to release this video for free as a guide to avoiding unnecessary injury that I have observed over the years and which made a concrete difference in my training room. A few simple training protocols can really make a difference. Pareto‚Äôs principle applies in so many aspects of life - including Jiu jitsu injuries. A few moves cause the overwhelming majority of severe/catastrophic injuries and removing them and replacing them with safer and more effective alternatives makes a real difference in gym safety. I will announce when editing is done and it is released. We all love training and we all accept that accidents happen - BUT UNNECESSARY ACCIDENTS DON‚ÄôT HAVE TO HAPPEN - to keep your progress strong you need to be in the gym - and severe injuries will keep you out of the gym - so let‚Äôs train hard but also train SAFE to maximize your progress!!
"
"Immobilization is one of the great keys to submission success: Finishing a submission hold on a tough moving opponent is never easy. If you can immobilize then prior to and during the execution of the lock or strangle your chances of success rise dramatically. Many of the best immobilizations come from trapping your opponents head and shoulders between your knees. This leads to many upper body submissions. Note that you need only immobilize the relevant parts of the body. So for a juji gatame arm bar you need to immobilize the head and shoulders, for heel hooks the area between his hip and knee. When I say immobilize, understand that you‚Äôll never be able totally an active opponent - you just have to immobilize part of his body long enough to apply the hold, if you can‚Äôt immobilize even the relevant part of his body, at least slow it down to a speed where you can create sufficient pressure in the available time to get a submission. Stop him or slow him, if you can‚Äôt you‚Äôll need a very quick execution of the lock that tends to lack the kind of control needed to beat the toughest opponents
"
"Favorite moves: All great athletes have their signature moves. These form the basis of their attacking game. Once you develop one solid attacking move it will force opponents to react to it in predictable ways. This will enable you to develop follow up moves that counter your opponent‚Äôs counters to that original move. Thus does the original move function like the trunk of a tree and from that trunk grows multiple branches and from them more branches until a complete tree grows and emerges. In this way a few favorite moves can create great growth across your entire game. I usually discourage athletes from trying to FORCE a favorite move. It will usually come to you naturally and organically as a response to your body type and personality and coaching lineage. Once you have a few favorites they will form the bedrock of your offense. Add appropriate supplements to those moves in response to opponent‚Äôs resistance and soon you‚Äôll have a complete offensive game that fits you as naturally as your favorite clothes
"
"Emotion: This game is about decision making and calculating risk and reward. Emotion doesn‚Äôt help decision making and calculation. I find most people do their best work in a calm and emotionless state. It‚Äôs sometimes difficult to achieve this in the pressure of competition but you don‚Äôt have to be perfect - just better than the other fellow. The time for emotion is after the performance - then you can let out whatever you were holding back!
"
"Be careful who you train with - set basic safety protocols in class and you will greatly reduce time away from the mat caused by unnecessary injuries.
"
"Two approaches to strangulation: The classic and time honored approach to getting rear strangles in jiu jitsu has always been to establish position and control first and then strangle second. In the vast majority of cases this is definitely the better approach. However, you should not neglect the skill of setting the strangle first and then establishing the positional control as they fight to defend the initial threat of the strangle. Many opponents have strong defensive skills and it may not always be possible to sink a strangle after you get to rear mount. Sometimes you will get better results by immediately sinking your strangle arm in deep in the midst of a scramble, creating a strong threat and distraction that will allow you to then set your position. You will then find yourself with both position and a fully set strangle in place - which very few of your opponents will be able to stop. So yes - in the majority of cases, stick to the classic method - but don‚Äôt close your mind to occasionally reversing the usual order of things and attack the strangle first - especially when you‚Äôve already found it difficult to break through with the usual methods.
"
"Know what you want before you make contact but be prepared to work with what you get given if you can‚Äôt get your first choices - in this respect Jiu jitsu mirrors life
"
"It start with your hands: Jiu jitsu is all about EVER INCREASINGLY CLOSE CONTACT INTO EVER INCREASINGLY MORE ADVANTAGEOUS POSITIONS. But that close contact has to start somewhere - and in the majority of cases that will be with the HANDS. get used to coming at the start of each engagement with hands ready for action. Work to get your hands into grips and positions from which all the subsequent movements you require can follow naturally. Condition your hands for hard gripping strength and endurance - I always recommend rope climbing above all other methods - but remember always that efficiency of grip always counts for more than strength of grip.
"
"Your mind is your greatest weapon - but your legs are a close second: We‚Äôve all had the disconcerting experience of grappling against someone far stronger than ourselves. It‚Äôs a bad feeling when your opponents hands easily peel off your best grips and pull out of your best holds. Whenever you feel outgunned in strength - it‚Äôs time to use your basic knowledge of the human body in your favor. No matter how much stronger your opponents hands and arms may be than your hands and arms - his hands and arms are not stronger than your legs. Make it a fight of your legs against his arms and you can realistically beat stronger people. The best place for you start this study is submission holds that directly match your legs against an opponents head and arm - and the triangle is king of this. Make it central to your training - and more importantly - central to your JIU JITSU MINDSET. THINK in these terms and you will begin to ACT in these terms, and then you may start to surprise yourself when grappling bigger and stronger opponents
"
"You step on the mat alone: In Jiu jitsu and in life - you‚Äôre always surrounded by people offering advice and ideas - that‚Äôs fine. Most of the time they have good intentions and sometimes the advice is very helpful. Understand however, that it‚Äôs you and not them who has to do your work so make sure it‚Äôs your own inner voice that does most of the talking in your pre match time rather than the voices coming from the outside. You‚Äôve got a skill set and a game plan based upon your body type and personality that‚Äôs been developing a long time - don‚Äôt compromise it by following commands from other personalities and body types that conflict with what you‚Äôve built. Always seek to express who YOU are rather than other peoples conceptions of who you might be.
"
"Intensity: The first thing you‚Äôll notice when you compare a competition match or a very hard sparring match where neither of you wants to lose versus a relaxed gym match where you‚Äôre focused more on technical growth rather than winning; is that the INTENSITY immediately rises several levels above normal. This will have several immediate effects. The first is that breathing will become shallow and restricted and quickly fall behind the demand for oxygen that the extra muscular effort demands. The second is that you will tend to keep muscular tension longer and at higher levels and experience greater lactic acid build up than usual. In some cases you may even experience adrenaline build up and release that can create an initial sensation of impaired muscle control when adrenaline levels are high and then a sudden strength loss when your adrenaline diminishes. Mentally, you will often experience a tunnel vision as you focus on an initial move or game plan and your heightened focus on that prevents you seeing any alternatives that arise as the match progresses. You will also find that as anxiety increases, so does your aversion to risk. You‚Äôll restrict yourself only to your most trusted moves and shy away from trying anything else, thus shrinking your skill set well below what you normally exhibit in a more relaxed setting. Now if all this sounds bad - you‚Äôre right - it is - but it gets worse. As you start to experience these effects, you naturally get MORE anxious as you feel your physical and mental attributes diminish and this will further increase anxiety, creating a downward spiral of anxiety and effects that compound each other until you find yourself exhausted just a few minutes into the match - which is shocking because in regular training you may be capable of sparring for thirty minutes straight without a problem. This can be a shocking experience the first time you feel it come on. Be aware that it generally gets better with time. If you can survive the initial shock you‚Äôll often be able to recover in the course of the match and exhibit a ‚Äúsecond wind.‚Äù Make sure you get to feel the sensation from time to time so that the shock value diminishes

"One good weapon: Having one good weapon doesn‚Äôt sound like much in a sport where there are thousands of moves and techniques to learn. Remember however, that ONE GOOD WEAPON ALWAYS BEGETS MORE WEAPONS. Why? Because when your opponent fears one strong weapon that you possess, he will tend to react to that threat in predictable ways that make the application of other weapons much easier. Best of all is when you have a strong technique that goes in one direction and another follow up that goes in the opposite direction - then you can play the two against each other and breakthrough even very tough defenses. The way of good jiu jitsu always follows this path of developing a few favored weapons that are like the trunk of a strong tree, and from that tree sprout many branches, just as many subsequent moves sprout off the development of those strong moves of yours. The Japanese noted this pattern long ago and created a work ‚Äútokui-waza‚Äù for this kind of favorite or strong technique. Make sure your development makes use of this essential feature of the sport
"
"Make it a little easier for yourself: In Jiu jitsu the basic lines of defense for most scenarios are pretty well known. For example, in standing position your opponents head, hands and elbows/forearms are his initial lines of defense - to get into offensive positions you‚Äôll have to work past them. Every one of the major scenarios has similar initial lines of defense. If you know what they are, you know what you‚Äôll have to get past in order to attack effectively. Once you gain this knowledge and act on it, the game becomes easier. Remember, it not your ability to perform the moves of Jiu jitsu that counts - it‚Äôs your ability to perform them AGAINST KNOWLEDGEABLE RESISTANCE that counts. Learn what you have to fight past and you‚Äôll get there much more often!

"In a tough match against an opponent your own size and skill level you will probably get less than three opportunities to finish - your training must reflect this reality. As much as we like to learn new novelties and tricks, it must be understood that these are generally of use only when matched against easy opponents. In a tough match you will always be forced back to your most trusted weapons. MAKE SURE YOUR BEST WEAPONS ARE YOUR MAJOR FOCUS IN MATCH PREPARATION AND THAT YOU CONSTANTLY LOOK FOR WAYS TO IMPROVE YOUR PERFORMANCE OF THEM AND ADD NEW SET UPS, VARIATIONS AND FOLLOW UPS TO KEEP THEM EVOLVING. You will be judged NOT BY HOW MANY MOVES YOU KNOW, but rather by HOW MANY YOU CAN APPLY ON THE TOUGHEST OPPONENTS, and this number is quite small EVEN FOR THE BEST IN THE WORLD.
"
"Base: Whenever you are in standing position or top position it is generally demanded of you to keep a solid base of support that enables you to keep standing or top position as long as you desire it. Intuitively it feels like the best way to keep a strong base of support is to WIDEN your base as much as possible. This would be true if you were alone and static - but in a match you aren‚Äôt - you are constantly moving in response to an opponent. As such width of base is only a part of the story. What you really want is a DYNAMIC BASE. It will be your ability to maintain base through MOVEMENT that makes you successful against a resisting opponent. It‚Äôs not so much the stationary width of of your base as your ability to step and post to a new base of support in response to second by second changes as the match unfolds. Very often this means taking a rather narrow initial stance so that you can pick up a foot easily and move it, rather than a heavy, exaggerated wide stance that makes it difficult to make a reactionary step in response to an opponents movement. Here, Daniel Manasoiu uses a good natural stance to easily pick up a foot and move to a new base of support in response to an opponent trying to off balance him at the 2022 ADCC World Championships
"
"Offensive and defensive initiative from guard: Whenever you are in a competitive match with a skilled opponent and making use of guard position, there will be times your opponent has the offensive initiative and is fighting to pass, and you are primarily defensive - fighting only to retain your guard with no thought of offense. Then there will be other times where you have the offensive initiative - you are trying to sweep or submit your opponent and he is in defensive mode with no thought of passing. Usually it goes back and forth until there is a score. It is very important that you fight to finish every defensive period with a transition into some form of guard that enables you to enter into an offensive period. You cannot just continually play defense/retention. A good opponent will eventually crack even the toughest walls, and even if he does pass he will surely win a decision. Every cycle of defense/retention must be followed by an immediate switch into an offensive cycle where you carry the fight to your opponent. I‚Äôm sure you can all guess my favorite way to do this - pommel you‚Äôre legs into some variation of ashi garami at the completion of every act of retention and get straight into counter offense to start your own period of offense. Whatever method you choose - make sure follow each period of defense/retention with your period of offense/sweep/submission - that way you will carry the fight To your opponent rather than just worn down over time by continuous defense.

"I had a fun time working some jiu jitsu with Maynard James Keenan @iamthebriefcase from the rock band Tool, who has been doing jiu jitsu for a very long time and has an excellent technical grasp of the sport. It was a lot of fun going over triangle entries and finishes. He impressed everyone with his ability! He also has a a great personal history in Jiu jitsu - studying with Rickson and his students in the early days in California - traveling long distances to train long before he gained fame in the music world and still finding time to train as a rock star on the road. He also gave us some fascinating insights into the world of rock music and super stardom - those guys have a lifestyle that very few can handle! Our lives are very simple and easy by comparison!! I was struck by the similarities on a much smaller scale of stage presence and performance between rock music and jiu jitsu as Mr Keenan told his tales. Learning to get comfortable and perform consistently on stage is a struggle for developing athletes but rock musicians have to deal with this on a MUCH bigger scale and under tremendous pressure. What a pleasure to meet such an interesting fellow under the umbrella of Jiu jitsu. After the training session he went on the do the Joe Rogan @joeroganexperience @joerogan podcast - I can‚Äôt wait to see that to get more insight from this fascinating fellow!
"
"Crowds: Interesting things start to happen when you go to perform in front of a crowd. Movements that you do easily and comfortably alone suddenly become problematic - indeed, You may not even attempt these movements. Why? What is it about the presence of the crowd? It‚Äôs the feeling and the fear of being JUDGED and found wanting by the audience. We all deeply care about other peoples perceptions of us and the thought of being judged poorly by a mass of people - even people we don‚Äôt know and have no interaction with - is hard to take. In this sense a professional athlete must become something more than just an athlete and become a PERFORMER in the same way a musician, an actor, a circus acrobat, an orator or anyone else who makes a living in front of a crowd must do. Interestingly in my experience a small crowd can be just as intimidating as a big crowd because it‚Äôs more personal - you see individual faces and people, hear conversation and words more clearly. Getting comfortable with the idea of being judged en masse by a group of strangers is essential to a competitive athlete and indeed, all of us, since it can happen repeatedly on a smaller scale in your everyday life at any time. Everyone has to find their own way to get around it - I‚Äôve never seen any one size fits all approach that works for everyone - but get around it you must, whether it be by competing so often you just get used to it over time, or some psychological insight, for if you don‚Äôt get around it, you‚Äôll never perform in your heaviest moments as well as you do in your lightest moments
"
"Getting under opponents: When it‚Äôs time to fight underneath an opponent it‚Äôs natural to want to keep their weight as far away from you as possible. This can certainly be an effective tactic, but there is much to be said for the opposite approach - IF YOU ARE GOING TO FIGHT UNDERNEATH SOMEONE, THEN GET AS FAR UNDER THEM AS YOU CAN. The advantage of this is that you can get under their center of gravity and LIFT people, and if you can get that incredible feeling of of effortless lifting that comes with good positioning under their center of gravity - you can make even the heaviest people feel light. That‚Äôs when the most beautiful sweeps in Jiu jitsu become possible and you can whip an opponent over and take top position in style
"
"It ain‚Äôt over until it‚Äôs over: There are many times in jiu jitsu when your opponent will get into scoring/submission positions on you. The more layered your defensive abilities the better you will do. The best athletes can be taken all the way into what appears to be hopeless situations and still navigate their way out and get back on the attack. If you can do this it will have a crushing effect on your opponents psyche. There are few feeling in jiu jitsu worse than getting to your best position and being on the cusp of victory and having a skilled opponent finagle his way out and immediately counter attack. The majority of your ability to do this is knowledge/skill, but undeniably some of it is psychological as you have to keep a calm mind under crises situations. You don‚Äôt want your first experience of this to occur in competition - make sure you practice it regularly in the gym with partners who can turn the heat down so that you can start without getting crushed and build intensity as your skill rises. If you can prolong scramble long enough you can exhaust opponents physically and break them mentally with their own favorite moves - this is high level Jiu jitsu indeed
"
"Learn to get comfortable in inverted positions on your shoulders and double the number of submission entries you can attempt: When we first start jiu jitsu we all learn the fundamental attacks from bottom guard positions with our head far away from our opponent and our hips closer to the opponent than your head. That is sensible because Jiu jitsu evolved as a fighting style and in a fight it‚Äôs generally wise (especially at beginner level) to keep your head as far away from an opponents fists and elbows as possible. This does rather limit your submission entries however. In a sport context where strikes are not an issue, inversion under your opponents upper body with your head closer to your opponent than your hips suddenly opens up a vast new set of submission entries from unexpected angles. Because your legs are unweighted in these scenarios, they move quickly and easily into attacks. Here, Nicky Ryan inverts Unser brother Gordon to enter into triangles, arm bars, omoplatas. He could also easily go downstairs into leg locks. Learning to get comfortable in these inverted positions is a big part of your development in the bottom submissions game. Time spent getting yourself to relax and breath freely in positions like this will make you able to spin like a top under a tough opponent and whip your legs into attacks that can turn a match around in a second.

"am very happy to announce the release today of my latest instructional video: AGELESS JIU JITSU: WINNING WHEN YOU‚ÄôRE OLDER OR LESS ATHLETIC: TOP GAME: NO GI. In this video I look at how players who feel they are somewhat athletically compromised by age or injury or just a lack of athletic background before beginning Jiu jitsu can develop an effective no gi top game that enables them to be highly competitive against younger and more athletic opponents. Athletic ability is not delved out equally and doesn‚Äôt last forever so it‚Äôs important to understand that if the body is somehow lacking, your mind must make up for that lack with sound tactics and technique selection. There are ways to approach the game that require less speed, flexibility and muscular endurance that are nonetheless highly effective even at the highest levels; and by focusing on this aspects you can extend your effectiveness further than many believe is possible. All of the techniques selected require little to no athleticism and are encased in a game plan designed to inhibit movement and slow a younger and more athletic opponent down to a pace and positions where control is possible and knowledge rather than speed or explosiveness become the deciding factor. If this sounds like something your interested in, check it out at @bjj.fanatics Link in my story and bio

"Athleticism: I think it‚Äôs fair to say most people in Jiu jitsu have a feeling that everyone else in the room is a better athlete than they are. Yet when you ask them what they mean by this they point to a list of physical attributes - speed, flexibility, endurance etc and say that most people possess these in greater amounts than they do and this makes them inherently better athletes or possessed of greater athletic potential. In fact the single biggest contributor to your athletic potential at any given second in a match is not genetic - it‚Äôs learned - it is your STANCE. Every task in the sport has a stance or posture that determines how efficiently you will perform that task. I don‚Äôt care how good someone‚Äôs genetic athleticism is (however you understand that) - IF THEY ARE IN A POOR STANCE FOR A GIVEN TASK, THEY WILL STRUGGLE TO PERFORM THAT TASK. The converse is also true. NO MATTER HOW POOR YOUR PERCEIVED ATHLETIC POTENTIAL IS, IF YOU ARE IN A GOOD STANCE TO PERFORM A GIVEN TASK, YOU WILL MAKE IT LOOK EASY. Your objective athletic potential is heavily dependent on factors outside your control, but plays much less of a role than many people think in the here and now of a match. Much more important is MAXIMIZING WHATEVER ATHLETIC POTENTIAL YOU HAVE BY TAKING A STANCE THAT MAXIMIZES PERFORMANCE OF THE TASK IMMEDIATELY IN FRONT OF YOU. Don‚Äôt worry too much about whatever objective athleticism fate gave you. Focus instead on the athletic potential you give YOURSELF by adopting a strong and appropriate stance for the task in front of you. Here, Garry Tonon takes a good stance for toreando guard passing that allows easy side to side movements and makes entanglement by opponents legs difficult while allowing his hands easy access to grips upon opponents legs.

"Great night of grappling in Las Vegas! The @ufcfightpass Grappling Invitational out on a great event here is Las Vegas tonight featuring a tournament and several high profile super fights under EBI rule set. Teenage blue belt phenom @helenajiujitsugirl Helena Crevar took on black belt champion Emily Fernandez and won with a an excellent stranglehold from the back, showing the audience her incredible potential for the future. Nicholas Meregali @nicholasmeregali had a match against the great ADCC champion Cyborg Abreau. It was a close fought battle with Mr Meregali initiating all the attacks but Mr Abreau survived to force over time where Mr Meregali won via juji gatame armbar. In the tournament Dan Manasoiu @jiujitsugiant showed everyone the impressive improvements he has made to his game. He won his first two matches with the best submissions of the night - two beautifully applied leg locks. In the finals he had a great match against former team mate Nicky Rod. It went to over time where there was a dramatic moment where Mr Manasoiu came very close to locking in a juji gatame arm bar, but Mr Rodriguez showed good escape skills and presence of mind to escape and then win via stranglehold. In the main event Craig Jones squared off against Felipe Pena. Both men are mostly known for their guard game, but in this match neither wanted to play bottom position and opted to most grapple in standing position presumably so that they could save energy for the over time. Overtime was interesting. Mr Jones got a good early escape in the first over time round which proved decisive as neither could escape the other after that, thus Mr Jones won a tough tactical match via ride time. Once again it‚Äôs great to see the UFC putting their resources behind grappling. I‚Äôm very happy that the audience got to see the rapid improvements youngsters Helena Crevar and Daniel Manasoiu have made and how they are climbing rapidly towards their goals. Hope you all enjoyed the show!!

"Vinny Magalhaes had to withdraw last minute from his super fight with Gordon Ryan @gordonlovesjiujitsu in the UFC Grappling Invitational @ufcfightpass after complications with his weight cut (UFC set a limit of 235 pounds). He has been replaced by the great Nicky Rod @nickyrod247 - two time ADCC silver medalist and one of the very best professional grapplers in the game today. Originally Mr Rodriguez was to compete in the Open Weight Tournament, but he stepped in last minute after the UFC was informed of Mr Magalhaes situation. This will be a rematch - the two former team mates met in the final of the ADCC World Championships earlier this year - Gordon Ryan won that encounter via heel hook, but this is a new match. Importantly, it will be fought under different rules - EBI Rules - Nicky Rod recently won the EBI Open Weight tournament in spectacular fashion - every match via submission, showing the world his prowess in this rule set. As former sparring partners each knows the others game very well land what they have to do to win! The size, speed, flexibility, mobility and strength advantage will go to Nicky Rod, he weighed in around 230 pounds to Mr Ryan around 220, but Gordon Ryan is a true master of technique and uses it to exert unprecedented levels of control over even the most physically formidable opponents - keep your eyes on this match!! Mr Rodriguez‚Äôs place in the tournament will be taken by the very talented young South African grappler Luke Griffith @luke_griffithjj He takes his place among a very talented field under EBI rules in matches of eight minute duration. In addition Dan Manasoiu @jiujitsugiant will take on brilliant Brazilian world champion Ricardo Evangelista @ricardoevangelista - both men are huge heavyweights well over 250 pounds but who move like lightweights! The great MMA fighter Miesha Tate @mieshatate will take on Bia Mesquite  @biamesquitajj one of the greatest female grapplers of this era in the co main event superfight! This will be a great event hosted by the @ufc It is wonderful to see the worlds premier MMA organization getting involved in professional grappling! Tune in tomorrow night!!

"Controlled but dangerous: There is a huge difference between a match where you find yourself against an opponent from whom you feel no danger versus one where you feel the opponent can hurt you at any moment. In the first case there is a light hearted feel to the match, in the second case you will feel significant stress. More significantly you will take FAR LESS RISK when matched against a dangerous opponent and play with a safety first attitude that will inhibit your game a little. The point is this - WHEN PLAYING A DANGEROUS OPPONENT YOU WILL PLAY A VERY DIFFERENT GAME THAN WHEN FACING AN OPPONENT FOR WHOM YOU FEEL NO FEAR. Make yourself dangerous and opponents will play a very respectful game against you. When I say dangerous I do NOT mean RECKLESSLY DANGEROUS. No one enjoys being being matched against someone who intentionally or uncontrollably injures training partners. Play like that and very soon you won‚Äôt have anyone to play with. I mean someone who plays with control but who conveys the feeling that if they wanted to do harm, they absolutely have the firepower to do so. The best way for you to create this aura is to have a STRONG SUBMISSIONS GAME. Nothing scares opponents in Jiu jitsu as much as the threat of being FINISHED. Make sure that you devote time in your training to developing a strong submissions arsenal and you‚Äôll always get a healthy respect from all opponents that will result in them taking fewer risks and attacks against you for fear of the consequences. Never be happy with a neutered Jiu jitsu that presents no danger to opponents. What makes Jiu jitsu a MARTIAL art is submissions - never lose sight of this

"The second you make contact with the leg - attack your opponents balance: A very common problem you will see in Jiu jitsu athletes is a tendency to simply pick the leg up when going into their high single legs. As a result their opponents can easily maintain balance on one leg and because they are in good balance, they can immediately go into strong counters - Guillotines, Kimura, leg lock entries - all kinds of problems. It is very important that the second you get two hands to the leg, you immediately exert strong downward pressure with shoulder/chest whilst pushing with your head so that your opponent is out of balance with weight in his heels. Often this will force him to use his arms to help regain balance - this precludes him from using this arms to lock up his guillotine, Kimura and leg lock counters. All his attention will be momentarily taken up with staying up rather than attacking you. Then you can focus on the task of completing the takedown without the distraction of defending yourself from his counters. Make a habit doing more than picking the leg up - make sure you go further disturb his balance at the same time and keep him hopping and reaching so they he never gets settled enough to counterattack so you can make a smoother completion to your takedown
"
"Sitting on the sidelines: There will always be times injury takes you off the mat. Whenever that occurs I always encourage students to come in and watch. Part of the motivation is to keep their spirits up, but far more important is the need to keep their progress going even when you can‚Äôt physically participate. Never forget that every physical action in Jiu jitsu begins with a mental decision to act that way. You can use this insight to help your progress when you can‚Äôt physically perform the moves. Watch matches from the sideline - but don‚Äôt watch for ENTERTAINMENT by simply seeing who wins and who loses. Watch to LEARN and IMPROVE by MENTALLY PARTICIPATING IN THE MATCHES YOU WATCH. Put yourself in the place of the two athletes, sometimes the offensive player and sometimes the defensive player. Don‚Äôt FOLLOW the action with your eyes, PREDICT and JUDGE the action with your MIND. This is the best and most important participation you can engage in when your body can‚Äôt engage. When the body can‚Äôt engage - THE MIND STILL CAN - and that mental engagement will allow noticeable improvement when you return. Never forget that physical action action begins with mental decisions and use this to your advantage next time you can‚Äôt physically train.

"The central tactical message of combat sports: The aim of combat sports is to make the inherently difficult task of defeating a tough and strong adversary significantly easier through training various techniques and tactics that increase the probability of you winning. The means by which this aim is fulfilled is universal across all combat sports - PUT YOURSELF IN LOCATIONS WHERE YOU CAN ATTACK YOUR OPPONENT MORE READILY THAN HE CAN ATTACK YOU. Different combat sports have different ways of doing this. Some do it through distance, some via angle, some via level, some through striking, some through grappling - but the same basic idea persists and forms the core of intelligence applied to personal unarmed combat. In jiu jitsu it is done primarily through POSITION. two positions above all - the mount and the rear mount. In grappling jiu jitsu where striking is not permitted, I believe that the rear mount is the single best positional pin of them all. Seek it at all times - the athlete who actively LOOKS for the back will always FIND the back - it‚Äôs that simple. THE EYES WILL ALWAYS SEE WHAT YOU TELL THEM TO LOOK FOR FOR - tell them to look for the back and you‚Äôll see the everywhere you grapple - and then you‚Äôll win a lot of matches!

"am very pleased to announce the release of my latest instructional video AGELESS JIU JITSU: WINNING WHEN YOU‚ÄôRE OLDER OR LESS ATHLETIC: TOP GAME GI This is the last of the series designed to cover top game in the gi for players who feel age or lack of athletic background is a factor in how they play jiu jitsu but want to increase their effectiveness. It gives a roadmap of technique selection and tactics to allow athletes with mobility issues to be highly effective against younger, faster and more mobile opponents. The gi is an incredible tool to bind up and control opponents and used well it can totally alter a mobility asymmetry between two athletes. As always the ideal is control that leads to submission and the submissions selected take advantage of the collars that function like a noose around an opponent‚Äôs neck at all times - whoever puts himself in a position to access that noose first is just a step away from victory.

"You‚Äôre in a winning position - now is not the time for excitement: It perfectly natural and understandable that you should get excited when you get to a winning position against a tough opponent. However, getting excited won‚Äôt make it easier to finish. Now is the time for calculation and remembering the skills needed to finish the job. Stay cold and dispassionate and work methodically, the same way you would to solve a math problem - did getting excited or emotional ever help you solve a math problem? No - and it won‚Äôt help you solve a Jiu jitsu problem either. Save your excitement for after the job is complete and you will experience excitement a lot more than if you let it creep in too early

"Pinning: The notion of pinning is central to almost all forms of grappling. In sports like wrestling and judo, pinning can end a match just as submissions do in Jiu jitsu. Jiu jitsu approaches pins from a very unique perspective - pins are understood to derive their value from their FIGHTING value. Only pins that prevent and opponent using their legs to defend themselves and enter into sweeps and submissions are acknowledged - so the first prerequisite is that you get completely past your opponents legs. The other guiding idea is that you should be able to create an asymmetry in attacking potential - an ability to strike or submit an opponent far more readily than he can return fire. The more this asymmetry is exhibited, the better the pin. Learning to get to, maintain, move from one pin to another and attack from a pin is the centerpiece of the top game in our sport. Work first on MAINTAINING a pin against resistance - that‚Äôs the first skill of pinning. Then work on moving smoothly from ONE PIN TO ANOTHER (and back if necessary) without being put back in guard - that‚Äôs your second skill. Once you‚Äôve gotten strong in these two skills, it‚Äôs time to move to the third - attacking from pins with submissions. This can be frustrating at first because you usually have to relinquish the pin itself to do so, but it represents the pinnacle of pinning so it‚Äôs a hurdle you must jump!
"
"Ninety percent of your opponents takedown defense and counter offense comes from his head, hands, arms and hips - if you can get behind him, you‚Äôve immediately disarmed the overwhelming majority of his defense and made your job of taking him down MUCH easier and safer. There are significant benefits to starting with position before takedown whenever it‚Äôs possible for you to do so. You can‚Äôt always do it, but when you can, it‚Äôs a truly great option. Opponents that seem impossible to takedown from the front can often be put down much more easily from the back and with a much better chance of scoring under Jiu Jitsu scoring criteria in the ensuing scrambles. Make a habit of working to get behind opponents in the standing position first and getting takedowns from chest to back positions. At the very least it‚Äôll create defensive reactions that open up more conventional frontal takedowns, and quite often it‚Äôll give you the positional advantage that allows for clean and decisive takedowns from the back that lead directly into the best scoring and submission positions in Jiu Jitsu
"
"Phases: an odd thing about my career in Jiu jitsu is that it went through three very distinct phases. When I began I was a bouncer working in night clubs and only interested in Jiu jitsu as a self defense skill. In time I became an instructor at my sensei Renzo Gracie‚Äôs academy and taught Jiu jitsu to all, but was most known for my work on MMA grappling through my student Georges St Pierre. Mr St Pierre was a super star and attracted many other great MMA athletes and grapplers. The emphasis accordingly was on no gi grappling appropriate to MMA competition with a heavy emphasis on takedowns, top control and escapes. After that came a third phase when submission grappling became very popular and the squad rose to prominence. Interestingly, each phase was around a decade in duration. Here is a classic photo of an afternoon class at Renzos probably around 2008. You can see Georges St Pierre, Roger Gracie, Romulo Barral, David Branch, my great unknown student Brian Glick, off camera is a very young Garry Tonon (he used to come in for MMA grappling with Tom DeBlass), Frankie Edgar, Rory MacDonald and Shawn Williams. It always brings a smile to my face when I think of those days - so many amazing people in one room battling towards their goals and helping others battle to theirs. I‚Äôve seen so many changes over the years in the people and places around me and I am eternally thankful for the changes and evolution they have all created within me.
"
"Distance: Grappling is won and lost at point blank range, but it starts at distance. It involves a constant ebb and flow of closing distance to attack and creating distance to defend. In between is the tactical game of deciding where and when to close distance. This is usually determined by the strategy and tactics of the two athletes. Generally those athletes who favor control leading to submission will press the closing of distance since that is how they win. Generally those who wish to win by a minimal score will seek to limit the closing of distance until the perfect conditions to score are set, then attack to score and then go back to a distance where they can avoid retaliation. Understanding how distance can be your ally and enemy is a big part of your grappling development. Try to develop a sense of distance in your daily training. Learn to read when you‚Äôre at a safe distance and how to close distance on someone who wants to keep you at bay - the awareness you build will be of great importance to you one day

Gordon will be taking his match on very short notice after brother Nicky had to pull out with knee problems. He takes on rising star Jacob Couch.

"
"When it‚Äôs over: When sparring or a match is over it tempting to just let emotion fill your mind - joy if you performed well, sadness or frustration if you lost. That‚Äôs fine initially, but at some point you want to go into ANALYSIS. In order to improve you must eliminate the mistakes made in previous performances. Even when you win you make mistakes. Continual improvement is more about ELIMINATION OF ERROR than it is about addition of new moves or tactics. Learning new moves takes substantial time, eliminating mistakes can in most cases be done relatively quickly. Just as it‚Äôs easier to make a car go faster and perform better by making it lighter than it is to put in a new engine in order to make it more powerful, so too, removing errors is easier than adding new moves. Next time you‚Äôve had a grueling training session or match, take the time afterwards to analyze your mistakes so that tomorrow you can begin the removal of errors that lower your current performance
"
"Getting out of trouble - and putting the other guy into trouble: If there is one skill in Jiu jitsu that NEVER goes out of style it would be getting out of bad position. I don‚Äôt care how talented an athlete is - we all make mistakes and at some time we all find ourselves fighting for survival out of pins. My approach to pin escapes is a little different from most. I train my students to work in two phases. First the escape itself - then to develop a sensitivity to when the danger is past and then AN IMMEDIATE AND AGGRESSIVE COUNTERATTACK THAT FEEDS OFF YOUR OPPONENTS DESIRE TO REGAIN THE PIN. This takes the humble art of defense into the devastating art of counterattack. Most athletes are satisfied with just getting. I teach to go the extra distance AND FINISH EVERY ESCAPE WITH SUBMISSION COUNTERATTACK WHENEVER POSSIBLE - and in MANY cases it is possible. Take this approach and you‚Äôll soon find that your submission percentages double. Tomorrow I will release my NEW WAVE JIU JITSU escapes into counterattacks instructional video and showcase this attacking philosophy into your defense.
"
"It takes a village: One of the greatest things about our sport is that it‚Äôs a club sport where the best athletes in the game work out daily alongside regular members of the gym. In most sports, elite athletes are carefully shielded away from ordinary folk - you won‚Äôt see Lebron James working out with average Joe players. In grappling and Jiu jitsu there is no separation between the elite and the recreational player. The result is that MANY recreational players develop a shocking high level of skill over the years, just in virtue of constantly working out with world class competitors and being exposed to the same techniques and tactics as them. I have seen many cases of recreational players give a very hard time indeed to visiting world champions - I don‚Äôt think you would see that in many sports. This is a wonderful thing - as the great rule is that THE STRONGER THE ROOM OVERALL - THE BETTER THE BEST MEMBERS OF THAT ROOM WILL BECOME. It becomes the rising tide that lifts all boats - some may float higher than others but all rise to some degree. Just as they say it takes a village to raise a child, so it takes a room to raise a champion - and the better that room overall, the better the champions who come out of it.

"If it ain‚Äôt tight - it ain‚Äôt right: When you start learning submissions it can be quite difficult to maintain a tight connection to your opponent as you try to perform the move. Space seems to inevitably develop between you and your drilling partner as you move further into the move. This is even more pronounced when you attempt it in sparring and the whole move often falls apart. This leads you to squeeze harder with your muscles to compensate and now you find yourself quickly getting tired performing large numbers of repetitions. Worse still, that tight musculature prohibits smooth movement and now you can‚Äôt even perform the move. The key to finding the tightness required for good submission holds that opponents can‚Äôt simply pull out of is MECHANICAL TIGHTNESS rather than MUSCULAR tightness. You want to be fairly loose as you move into the position , but SNAP INTO ISOMETRIC TIGHTNESS WHEN YOU GET THERE. Movement requires looseness and fluidity, locks require immobilizing tension - learning to reconcile these contradictory demands is the key to success with your submissions
"
"They say position before submission, but another very important notion is PRESSURE BEFORE SUBMISSION. Pressure doesn‚Äôt have to start with the Classic positional pins of Jiu jitsu - it can be applied from any situation where you have more control over your opponent than he has over you - even in neutral positions. Pressure saps your opponents energy as as energy decreases an opponents will to resist decreases in proportion. When the will is broken, that‚Äôs when submissions really have their maximum effect.

"If you can break their stance you can attack at will: Everyone wants to attack arms, legs and neck - that‚Äôs great, but do yourself a favor - attack their stance first and THEN their limbs. That way you‚Äôll have a much easier time against skilled opponents who would ordinarily stop your attacks. Your opponents defense always begins with stance. If you can take that from them they will have a difficult time stopping the next direction of attack!
"
"Fixating on where you want to be is half the battle: To a person who doesn‚Äôt know where they want to be jiu jitsu is a confusing mess. To a person who knows where they want to be but lacks the technical skill to get there, Jiu jitsu is a frustrating mess. Take heart however, just the act of mentally fixating on your positional goals will get you to them more often than you‚Äôd think. In a match there are myriad opportunities made available by the chaos of action that enable the athlete who keeps laser like focus on goals to identify opportunities and act on them immediately. As they say, a good plan enacted immediately is better than a great plan enacted later. So too in jiu jitsu. A decent move performed now is better than a mechanically perfect move performed too late. Just having that mental focus of where you want to be at all times will enable you overcome some shortcomings in technique and use opportunity as the path to the goal rather than mechanical perfection. Know where you want to be at all times and when at any time an opportunity presents itself - you‚Äôll be ready to get to your positional goals
"
"Opening gambits: Jiu jitsu is a game with a lot of chaos built into it that prevents us from ever fully knowing what will happen or what the best options are - nonetheless when you first go to engage with an opponent there are only so many opening moves. This is one area where you can go into a match with a pretty good idea of what will unfold based on initial movements. Make sure you have at least a few favorite options to come out with a plan rather than just come out and see what happens. I‚Äôm sure many of you will recognize the opening gambit shown here by a Craig Jones - a squad favorite and perfect for anyone looking to get off to ta strong start via leg locking.
"
"Jiu Jitsu exhibits the characteristics of both art and science: We usually make a pretty strong distinction between arts and science - look at any academic institution and you‚Äôll see that they are divided quite strongly into different faculties. Jiu Jitsu however, seems to have a foot in both departments. Insofar as it is a mechanical skill, based largely around making your body (and your opponents) into levers, fulcrums, wedges (incline planes) etc - it‚Äôs a scientific endeavor with objectively true and false answers to the questions we pose about technique. Insofar as it‚Äôs up to our choice as to which techniques we will employ and in what fashion, it‚Äôs a case of self expression where there is no right or wrong answer as to how one ought to act. Seen in this light it‚Äôs clear that there are times when there is a clear right and wrong way of playing the game, but just as many other times when there isn‚Äôt and that knowing the difference between the mechanical/scientific aspects of Jiu jitsu and the artistic/expressionist aspects is important for both teacher and student.
"
"Having a clear goal is half the battle: When you know where you want to be - you‚Äôll find ways to get there. When you don‚Äôt know where you want to be, there isn‚Äôt a map or compass in the world that can help you. So too in jiu jitsu. Have a clear idea in your mind where you want to be at all times and you‚Äôll navigate your way there eventually. When you start adding technical nuance that can help you get there efficiently, so much the better - it‚Äôll make your path much easier and more efficient - but knowing the goal is the most important thing since your innate creativity and ingenuity will eventually figure out a path. Of all the goals in Jiu jitsu the highest is submission, but that‚Äôs too broad to be of much use in a match. Better to think in terms of the back and the mount - at all times you should be thinking in terms of getting there from everywhere. This simple insight can give direction to your game that‚Äôll never let you down and ensure that you always grapple with a sense of direction.
"
"Negate first, attack second: Nothing is riskier than attacking an opponent who is simultaneously attacking you. If you have a big skill advantage this can work, but if you are well matched the result can go either way. A safer strategy is to begin by NEGATING YOUR OPPONENTS OFFENSE. Usually this is done by a combination of stance, positioning and grip. If you can first shut down an opponents ability to attack, then once this is achieved you can focus on your own offense with little distraction. Think about daily life - when you go to perform any given task you‚Äôll find it much more difficult if you‚Äôre being distracted and interrupted by someone as you try to perform than if you have no distractions. The same is true in Jiu jitsu. Try shutting down your opponents ability to grip you or get into threatening positions first and THEN enter into your attacks - it‚Äôs much easier when you can focus on what you‚Äôre doing rather than worry about what the other guy is doing
"
"A life of routine: We talk about a routine life as though it‚Äôs a bad thing - disparaging it as dull and boring and indicative of failed life choices. Let me be clear - almost all of our progress and achievement in life is founded upon the acquisition of skills, and skills are only acquired through the maintenance of a routine that gives you sufficient time and repetition to let them develop. If you want progress in Jiu jitsu or any other aspect in life, you will need to establish a routine and everything else in your life will have to be arranged around that routine. That doesn‚Äôt mean you have to condemn yourself to a dull life of boredom - but it does mean that you will have to avoid anything that interrupts the routine in a significant way. Routine isn‚Äôt something to be disparaged - on the contrary - it is the source and wellspring of your greatest resource - skill - and if you wish to rise to the top of your domain it will be skills developed by adherence to that routine that allow you to do so.
"
"The great advantage of half guard passing: There are many excellent ways to pass a tough opponents guard and get into your upper body pins; but the one I always favor above all others is half guard passing - why? The vast majority of guard passes always finish with control of an opponents head as the final step. You generally begin at the feet, progress to the knees and then beat the all important hips before settling into the penultimate step of pinning the head and shoulders. It‚Äôs almost always LEGS AND HIPS first and HEAD last. Half guard switches that all around. Most half guard passes begin with control of the head and shoulders first and then passing the hips second. This fundamental change of order creates a very impressive degree of control in half guard passing. Of all the methods of control, HEAD CONTROL is the most powerful, and the fact that you get it EARLIER in the case of half guard passing makes for an impressive improvement in control over most other passing methods. This allows it to be used by every body type, age category and people who would be considered un-athletic. You can truly use it to render a very athletically talented opponent ineffective.

"Do you remember the first time you successfully applied a submission hold? What was it? Did it become one of your main moves? When you first begin Jiu jitsu is probably fair to say that the positional moves are easier for most people to apply than the inherently more complex submission holds. Most of us successfully apply guard passes and pin transitions long before our first submission. I remember my first submission clear as day - it was an arm bar from guard - it was a move I struggled even to drill well as a beginner. One day I was sparring from guard with another white belt and I clumsily threw my legs around his head and yanked with lots of enthusiasm and zero technique - to my shock and amazement he tapped! Probably he tapped more from caution than the actual effect of the move since it was poorly applied - but it didn‚Äôt matter! Now the arm bar was my freaking move!! üòÇüòÇüòÇ For the next month I began in guard and that‚Äôs the only damn move I tried üòÇüòÇ This focus actually made my arm bar considerably better and by the end of the month I was actually having a lot of success with it! Remember: SUCCESS BEGETS SUCCESS. If you have early success with a move that is considered fundamental (not some crazy move that works once a year) - take it as a sign that you ought to focus on it for a while and see how far you can push that early success! You will often find that your body has its own way of showing where your talents are independent of your mind - when it speaks to you with initial success - sometimes it‚Äôs good to listen!
"
"Make sure you‚Äôre immune to your own poison: An odd thing about combat sports is that quite often (not always) athletes who excel at a given move are themselves surprisingly vulnerable to that same move. This might be because everyone they train with us so fearful of that move that the athlete in question never gets to practice defending it himself. So for example, when Garry Tonon fought Rousimar Palhares, a man greatly feared for his leg locks, I encouraged him to immediately attack Mr Palhares‚Äôs legs. If you have favorite moves - make sure you know both sides of them - attack AND defense. Only when you know both aspects can you rightly be described as a master of the position. Here, Gordon Ryan, master of back attacks, Does his time with the other half of back, mastery - defense
"
"Time: There is always a short time before the big event where your physical work is complete and now you have to wait to step up to the challenge. In that time keep your message to yourself simple and clear. Don‚Äôt let complexity dull your direction now. Every match has a simple theme running through it - keep your mind on that theme. Victory in any given match up will come from adherence to one or two simple ideas that confer you advantage over your opponent. For example, if you have a speed advantage over him, focus your thoughts on how speed can bring victory. See yourself as initiating action and moving away from threats with your speed. Picture your passing using methods where speed is a factor, such as toreando passes. In bottom position visualize yourself in open guards that allow speed of movement, rather than slower positions such as half guard or closed guard. When the action is close keep your thoughts simple and clear and the path to victory will be shorter and clearer!
"
"Visitors: We always love having visitors come by and train - they always provide new perspectives and challenges that help growth in all directions. Today we had the privilege of working with world class wrestlers associated with the Penn State program! @jaimeespinalpr @ant_thechamp_cassar @_joshrodriguez_  They showed how at the end of the day, all grappling styles are related - learning some Jiu jitsu applications of their wrestling skills they had a great workout with the squad! Once we open up our own place with more mat space we look forward to hosting more visitors and growing this sport some more!

"Sad news: Gordon Ryan will have to pull out of the WNO grappling super fight with Felipe Pena scheduled for this weekend in Costa Mesa. Mr Ryan was afflicted with severe stomach issues that resulted in a severe and quick weight loss/dehydration along with severe nausea and associated symptoms. He tried hard to shrug it off and bulldoze through it but to no avail. Even very mild workouts left him totally exhausted and physically debilitated. It was a tough call as both athletes had invested a lot in preparation for this match and expectations were high, but I believe it is the correct call. This match deserves both athletes in peak physical condition. The good news is that the event still has amazing matches scheduled for the fans. The great JT Torres returns to competition and Giancarlo Bodoni takes on world champion Pedro Merinho for the 205 point world title. The main event has been switched to Felipe Pena vs Nick Rodriguez. This should be a great match. These two had an epic match at ADCC with a Nicky Rod taking a closely fought victory via guard pass. This time however it‚Äôs a totally different rule set and thirty minutes long. Both are very physically imposing but in very different ways - one is fast and explosive, the other isometric Pythonesque strength. This should be a great match!! Keep tuned to @flograppling for updates for schedule, pre-match interviews etc
"
"The theoretical basis of the submission game in Jiu jitsu can be stated in a single sentence. USE A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF YOUR BODY AGAINST A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF YOUR OPPONENTS BODY TO CONTROL MOVEMENT AND EMPLOY LEVERAGE AGAINST A VULNERABLE POINT SUCH AS A JOINT OR ARTERY THAT WOULD RESULT IN INCAPACITATION OR SUBMISSION. This is everything we do.
"
"Opportunity: In a match against a tough opponent you may be presented with only one opportunity to make a decisive attack. Whether you do so successfully will come down mostly to two things - your ability to PULL THE TRIGGER when the moment arises and your ability to EXECUTE the move you have selected. The first is more psychological in nature and pertains to your confidence levels. The second is more physical in nature and pertains to your skill level. To shine under pressure you‚Äôll need both to work in harmony

"What the f**k are those guys wearing??!!! First training session for @nicholasmeregali in preparation for gi World Championships this morning. It‚Äôs a very impressive sight to watch one of the very best gi athletes of his generation in his element! Nicholas Meregali has the kind of gi game that everyone admires - fast tactical gripping into smooth positional advances finishing with devastating submissions. He has one of the most exciting gi games I‚Äôve ever seen, full of technical nuance, some beautiful original moves and that unmistakable Brazilian flair for movement and opportunity that characterizes so many of the top athletes from that nation. Now our fingers are all mangled and our ears on fire üòÇüòÇüòÇ Time for the no gi training session! üòúüòú I didn‚Äôt have a gi after the move from Puerto Rico, so I had to borrow one from from Nicholas. He gave me a black gi so i look like some dork showing up for his first Ninjitsu class hoping for a free shuriken üòÇüòÇüòÇ The transition from one game to another is a fascinating one - but at the end of the day it‚Äôs all jiu jitsu - just a different expression and a different set of problems to solve! Can‚Äôt wait to see how these sessions play out!
"
"The two most significant rules in Jiu jitsu with regards the standing game:  There are two rules in Jiu jitsu that make the standing game significantly different from other grappling sports. The first is the THREE SECOND RULE which states that takedowns only score when they exhibit control for three seconds after the takedown where the opponents hips/buttocks/back or knee is kept on the floor for the full three seconds. This is a very difficult criteria to satisfy and in competition often means that the critical three seconds generates a scramble and points are scored in the scramble rather than the takedown per se. The second crucial rule is THE GROUND ENGAGEMENT RULE which states that if an athlete elects to sit to guard position the other athlete MUST engage on the ground. This means you can never force the opponent to a standing match - it has to be something they want to engage in. It is this rule which makes it possible for Jiu jitsu students to completely ignore standing skills (other than the easy skill of pulling guard) and makes it important for us to know how to counter a guard pull - a skill that is not necessary in other grappling arts that don‚Äôt have this rule. All of your standing training training in Jiu jitsu has to factor in the effect of these two rules. Takedowns that would score in wrestling or Judo may not score at all in Jiu Jitsu and at any time you may have to abandon the standing game if an opponent sits to the floor. It is important that you adjust your techniques and tactics around these two unique rules of Jiu jitsu - they have a huge effect on the standing game in our sport
"
"Gi and no gi - the strangling medium: When it‚Äôs time to strangle someone with your upper body (strangles with the legs are quite different) there are options. In no gi grappling it will generally be your arms, in particular the biceps on one side and wrist/forearm on the other with the wrist/forearm side doing most of the work.  In gi grappling the preferred method will be with the opponents collar (there are other methods that are very effective). The collar has a thin edge to it that is harder and thinner than the forearm/wrist and thus does a better job of penetrating under the jaw to get to the carotid arteries. The collar mimics very well the superior strangling properties of a strong rope or sash that is the best means of strangulation you can ever use - but which of course is not an option in a Jiu jitsu match. There are a few cases where one can use naked strangles in a gi match, but in the vast majority of cases, the collar will provide a much better strangling medium than the arm/wrist. Here you can see the limits of a arm/wrist to penetrate under the jaw as Gordon Ryan strangles an opponent on his run to double gold at ADCC 2019. In this case he had to perform a mandible strangle over the jaw - less efficient but still very effective. A gi collar would allow much easier penetration under the jaw in circumstances like this due to its blade like edge. Learning to use the edge of the collar will make you strangle with even greater power and precision than you do with the arms.
"
"Defensive soundness: Just as a good boxer always protects himself at all times through either distance, head movement, motion, level change, high guard etc, so too a jiu jitsu athlete must always protect himself from the many dangers he faces from a skilled opponent the moment he engages. The basis of defensive soundness in jiu jitsu is always ELBOW/KNEE CONNECTION. The further apart your elbow and knee are from each other, the more vulnerable you are. Learn to play the game with a mindfulness for elbow/knee connection at all times and you‚Äôll find that you become a difficult target for even a good opponent to attack.
"
"Home: In early January I will go home to see my Mother in Australia. It‚Äôs been a very long time. Australia had very strict Covid laws that prevented my usual family visits for a long time, then I had to get started with a new team in a new location and get them ready for the ADCC World Championships. In that time I‚Äôve been a good coach - but a bad son. Now it‚Äôs time to go and see Mom (in New Zealand and Australia we say ‚ÄúMum‚Äù in the British fashion rather than the American ‚ÄúMom‚Äù). I will probably fly down early to mid January and spend a week or two there. I always love that journey and seeing my dear Mum and family - it‚Äôs a long journey but a good one!I‚Äôm also looking forward to seeing more of the incredible growth of Jiu Jitsu in Australia and New Zealand that has gotten them such great results in international competition in recent years! See you soon Mum!
"
"I am very happy to announce the release today of my latest instructional video from the NEW WAVE series NO GI GUARD PASSING. When my students first burst on to the grappling scene they made their name primarily from guard pulls into leg locks. While this was a devastating and game changing approach, it was never the whole picture. No one technique or tactic, no matter how devastating, can create SUSTAINED success at the highest levels. Always the goal is a COMPLETE game that enables you to attack the whole body. If you want to exert true control over the toughest opponents you must be able to attack the upper body and back from on top. As time developed my students came to be known also for a devastating no gi passing game that supplemented their lower body game brilliantly. Understand this: IN JIU JITSU THE VAST MAJORITY OF YOUR MAT TIME WILL BE SPENT EITHER PASSING OR PLAYING GUARD POSITION. You owe it to yourself to focus on those skills  to a greater degree than any other. In this video I show the technique and tactics that enabled my students to pass the toughest guards at the highest levels. We focus on a relatively small number of passes that are particularly well suited to no gi and which combine together into a proven system to make you effective in the least time possible. If it sounds like something you‚Äôd be interested in - check it out at BJJ FANATICS - link in my Instagram bio.
"
"It‚Äôs a game of posture: Good Jiu jitsu players always feel very difficult to attack for a simple reason - they are almost always in good posture and have the discipline to maintain that good posture through an entire match. Your job in Jiu jitsu always comes down to this simple edict: Maintain your own posture at all times whilst doing your utmost to break your opponents posture. Who wins and who loses in a tightly contested match will usually be decided by who did a better job of maintaining their own posture while undermine that of their opponent. Next time you feel stymied in your attacks against a tough opponent - start your attacks with an attack on his POSTURE and THEN the actual attack itself. I promise you this will garner you better results. Every position in Jiu jitsu has a posture appropriately it - once you know each posture and can correlate it the  positions in which it is needed, then it‚Äôs a matter of maintaining yours while breaking his - that is the essence of the entire game
"
"Working the sidelines: The best place to train in the room is of course, out on the mat. However, life has a way of taking us off the mat, injury for example. When this happens the next best place is the sideline - training your mind. When most people sit on the sideline and watch it‚Äôs for the purpose of ENTERTAINMENT. That‚Äôs fine, but you can do much better than that - watch for the purpose of gaining KNOWLEDGE. When you watch, imagine yourself as one of the people on the mat. Try to give better responses to the second by second action than the person you observe. What is he doing? What would you do better? Why is your recommended course of action better than his? Done this way you become an active MENTAL participant in their PHYSICAL struggle. Doing this will make your mental game very sharp and make the task of coming back to the physical game much easier
"
"What‚Äôs next? Here is an unpleasant truth. The vast majority of moves you attempt in Jiu jitsu will fail. This is true regardless of your skill level. The better you get, the better the opponents you will face. You both know the major moves of the sport. You both know the most reliable counters. Therefore, the vast majority of the moves you attempt against someone your own size and skill level will fail. Once you realize this, you realize that the most important question is not ‚Äúwhat move should I use?‚Äù But rather, ‚Äúwhat moves will I follow up with after my initial move.‚Äù Your whole way of thinking in Jiu jitsu must reflect the simple reality that most moves against a well matched opponent will fail and that you must always think in terms of WHATS NEXT? This is not something you can reliably figure out in the moment - you can get away with that on occasion but it‚Äôs much better to MAP THE OPTIONS OUT IN ADVANCE. I started with an unpleasant truth. Now let me offer a pleasant one. Against a well match opponent, most moves fail, however, well applied failed moves CREATE VERY PREDICTABLE DEFENSIVE REACTIONS FROM YOUR OPPONENT THAT ARE EASY TO EXPLOIT WITH SECOND, THIRD OR FOURTH MOVES. THAT is where the fight is really won or lost.  You know what your best attacks are - now it‚Äôs time to learn the most common reactions you see to them and map out your responses. In the great majority of cases the match is not won on the first attack, but by the second third or fourth - make sure your training and thinking reflects that
"
"Hands: Almost everything we do in grappling begins with the hands. Our hands are weak compared with the rest of the body, but they are dexterous and fast moving. In truth they don‚Äôt have to be that strong since their real function in grappling is as CONNECTORS. Our hands connect us to an opponent and the big muscles of the legs, hips and back do the heavy work. Nonetheless, without that connection through hand grip we wouldn‚Äôt be able to apply force into an opponent with the rest of our body. As such, when it‚Äôs time to shut down a dangerous opponents ability to attack us in grappling - HAND CONTROL is among the best methods. If you can strip away an opponents grip, trap his hands in place and/or frustrate his attempts to reestablish a lost grip, you can render his grappling skills null and void. Learn to distinguish when a hand grip is liable to cause you problems and if it is, take the time to nullify or remove it, then you can set your own positive grips and focus on your offense
"
"Jiu jitsu takedowns - amplitude: In most grappling sports there is great value not only in takedowns, but in the AMPLITUDE of takedowns. In other words, the more FORCEFUL the takedown as measured by momentum, height, the relationship between feet and shoulders of the person thrown and whether it lands them flat on their back etc then HIGHER THE SCORE THE TAKEDOWN WILL BE GRANTED. So takedowns are graded and scored according to their amplitude. In the case of Judo if sufficient amplitude is achieved along with the back landing on the mat, the match is over. In Jiu jitsu things are very different. First, a takedown can never end a match, not matter how perfect the landing. Second, ALL TAKEDOWNS SCORE THE SAME - regardless of how high or low the amplitude. The biggest and most powerful throw scores the same two points as the smallest trip. It goes further than this. In Jiu jitsu increases in amplitude often get PUNISHED rather than rewarded. The more amplitude is put into a takedown, the greater the danger of ROLL THROUGH - were the momentum of the throw creates a situation where there is no control at the conclusion of the takedown. Jiu jitsu demands that there be three seconds of positional control at the conclusion of the takedown. If roll through creates a situation where the control is weak (and it often does) - no points will be scored (only an advantage). Thus there is no real motivation in Jiu jitsu for big high amplitude throws and some reason to see them as disincentivized. As such, Jiu jitsu tends to favor smaller takedowns that do the minimum to bring the match to the floor and enable control in the aftermath of the takedown. There are still other good reasons to learn big throws - they can be a very valuable tool in some self defense situations and they can have an intimidating effect in matches that you can use in your favor. However, when working your takedowns in Jiu jitsu, always remember that control has greater value than amplitude and practice accordingly.
"
"Anyone can look calm and composed when they‚Äôre winning, but it‚Äôs how calm and composed you are when you‚Äôre in trouble that will do more to determine how well you do in your toughest matches. Every escape must begin with a mental commitment to composure, for only a calm mind can solve problems efficiently and every escape is just a solution to a problem applied under pressure.
"
"Position isn‚Äôt enough: You could make a good career in jiu jitsu just by getting into good positions. However, if you want to live up to the IDEAL of jiu jitsu, you‚Äôll need to go further and FINISH opponents. That means in addition to position, you‚Äôll need LIMB ISOLATION AND CONTROL from the pin that allows you to transition into the submission hold. You need a bridge between the POSITION and the SUBMISSION. The former is control over the TORSO, the latter is an attack on a LIMB. Without a bridge between the two you will rarely be able to go from one to the other. When you get good position on opponents make it your daily habit to go further and ISOLATE A LIMB so that you can translate positions into submissions. If you aren‚Äôt sure where to start, begin with under hooks - they are a relatively simple and easily understood method of isolating a limb from a variety of dominant positions. Remember, good jiu jitsu gets you into dominant positions, but great Jiu jitsu sees pins as a means to an end and strives to go further by isolating limbs from the pin and then attacking with submissions
"
"Guard position -The cycle of push and pull: In most cases the basic cycle of guard position is PUSH FIR DEFENSE - PULL FOR OFFENSE. In the majority of cases ( there are obvious exceptions) this holds true. Whenever some is close to passing our guard our first reaction is to PUSH and create space to recover our feet and knees. Whenever we want to bring an opponent forward into submissions or sweeps in a forward direction we PULL (pushing sweeps to the rear are the exception). Learning to cycle between pushing and pulling - offense and defense - is one of the fundamental skills of the sport. Your feet and knees, hands and elbows will be your primary pushers and pullers. Learning to use them in a team in opposing directions based upon what is unfolding second by second in a match will be one of your greatest areas of study. The switch from defense to offense back to defense happens very quickly and the better you and your opponents get, the faster it will have to be.
"
"Footsweeps: I think we all have moves that our favorites because they are high percentage and very effective for us - and moves that are favorites because they have an intrinsic cool or wow factor. For me, that was always foot sweeps. No other technique in all of combat sports conveys the effortless effect of total magic trick domination as a well applied foot sweep. In an instant you can drop or stumble an opponent seemingly with no effort, very little movement and low risk. The key is always to catch an unweighted foot. This means it requires timing and sensitivity to an opponents footwork. As such it can be frustrating when you first try as you usually fail to catch the foot in a state of weightlessness. Foot sweeps are a move that either works brilliantly or not at all - there is no middle ground. So have some patience when you start learning. It won‚Äôt come overnight. However, the potential rewards to the patient student are immense. You will have a weapon that can drop an opponent in an instant or stumble them into a secondary technique. Usually footsweeps are applied with both athletes in the standing position, but be are they are equally effective when you‚Äôre sitting and opponent is standing. Learn to catch that unweighted foot and you can make the mat into an ice skating rink where everyone slips and falls in front of you!
"
"Open guard knees to chest: People talk about posture all the time in Jiu jitsu - understand from the start that different situations will require different postures from you to maximize your efficiency. When it comes to open guard - if you do not have a controlling grip on your opponent - be sure to KEEP YOUR KNEES CLOSE TO YOUR CHEST. This lessens the chance of an opponent explosively clearing your legs and passing before you can react. It also lessens the danger of a quick leg lock entry by the top player. In short - it makes you DEFENSIVELY SOUND at all times until you can get a solid grip upon your opponent that allows you to focus on offense. Here, Australian grappling Star Craig Jones shows near perfect open guard posture, necessary because he does not yet have a controlling grip upon his partner.
"
"Giving it everything: When we think of giving it everything in some aspect of our life, whether it be in jiu jitsu or anything else, we typically think in terms of a single big challenge in which we give our all to prevail. So for example a very tough match in which we give everything we have to win. Certainly this is admirable and indeed necessary for your toughest matches, but the more difficult and important aspect of giving it everything is to do so over TIME. Most people can give everything they have for a ten minute match, but very few can give everything they have for ten years of a training program that prepares them for the biggest ten minute match of their life. Yet it‚Äôs who gives everything for ten years that will determine winner of loser, rather than who gives everything for that ten minutes. Your skill level is more important than anything for determining the outcome of your matches, and high level your skills are will be determined by your commitment over lonely years in gym workouts that no one sees rather than the few minutes you spend in front of an audience.
"
"Breaking stance and posture: Most Jiu jitsu students are made aware of the critical importance of stance and posture early in their training. You soon learn that breaking an opponents stance and posture pays big dividends in sparring. Perhaps the most impressive example of this is the one used the least - breaking an opponents stance and posture while attacking him with a submission hold. It‚Äôs bad enough to get caught in a tight submission hold - it‚Äôs TWICE as bad to get caught in a tight submission and then get your stance and posture broken down so that you cannot even defend yourself properly. Remember that submission defense almost always requires some kind of defensive posture - if you lose that then the hold becomes practically indefensible. Next time you are attacking a submission hold - GO THE EXTRA DISTANCE AND LOOK TO BREAK THE OPPONENTS STANCE AND POSTURE AS WELL - you will soon find far fewer opponents are escaping your favorite holds
"
"Action in Texas this Friday: This weekend the worlds most exciting grappler, Garry Tonon, will take on one of his toughest rivals, the extremely talented physical specimen Dante Leon, for a rematch after their classic confrontation at ADCC 2019. Mr Leon stunned everyone at that event by defeating the great Lucas Lepri, a man who undoubtedly ranks among the greatest Jiu jitsu players of all time. Mr Leon has an exceptional mix of positional and submission skills, along with excellent takedowns and is known for his devastating guillotine. Last time these two met, Mr Tonon was able to win after a tough battle with his dangerous leg locking skills - but as anyone familiar with top level competition will tell you - the difference between winner and loser at that level on any given day is so close that in the great majority of cases the outcome could be very different if the same athletes competed against each other the next day. Mr Leon is a smart and tactical player and doubtless has worked hard to improve in all the areas that Mr Tonon was able to use successfully last time. Unfortunately Gordon Ryan and Craig Jones tested positive for covid and will have to delay their matches until quarantine and subsequent testing is complete - then of course they would need some amount of time to get prepared. They were excited to face two of the legendary gym ATOS Jiu Jitsu‚Äôs most brilliant athletes, Lucas Barbosa and Ronaldo Junior - hopefully when medically cleared those matches can be rescheduled as they would have incredible for spectators. Looking forward to getting back to Texas! Hope you enjoy the show!

"Controlled intensity: One of the toughest tasks for a coach is to get students to regulate their intensity levels to the task at hand. We all have a natural tendency to work harder than we need for every task in jiu jitsu and get tired quickly as a result. The opposite mistake is to play so loose that you never get tired but your technique is so weakly applied that you simply aren‚Äôt effective. Somewhere in between there is controlled intensity. Here, you focus on controlling the TIME and LOCATION of intensity. Some tasks require a considerable power output from you - apply that power long enough to complete the task AND NO LONGER. With regards location, don‚Äôt tense up your WHOLE BODY if you only need to put tension into your legs to get a task completed. It‚Äôs very true that jiu jitsu technique does require considerable strength output at times - don‚Äôt let anyone kid you, it‚Äôs a physical game - but REGULATE that output so you don‚Äôt exhaust yourself. Controlled intensity is the hallmark of good jiu jitsu athletes

"Observations - women sparring men in Jiu Jitsu: Probably one of the toughest assignments in all of Jiu jitsu is for a woman to submit a male who has the same amount of training time and the size and strength disadvantage that is typically found in this scenario. Over many years of observing mixed classes with men and women grappling each other I came to the conclusion that BY FAR the most successful submission hold for women when they take on trained men is the HEEL HOOK - nothing else is even close in my experience. Let me explain this. The strength discrepancy between men and women is much more pronounced in the upper body than lower body. It is particularly pronounced in hand and arm strength. The discrepancy between men and women in lower body strength is far less pronounced. When two men of different size and strength clash I usually favor strangles from the back as the best submission hold for the smaller and weaker fellow - but in the case of women versus men I frequently observe that the big difference in hand/arm strength means that women struggle to win the hand fight that precedes strangulation (the rear triangle works much better for women in this scenario and it is my belief that rear triangle is second best submission for women against men after heel hook). Most of the other classic upper body submissions such as arm bars, Kimura, front triangles run afoul of the arm/upper body strength discrepancy and as such appear to be quite problematic for many females to use against similarly skilled males. Even most leg locks are problematic - knee bars and toe holds require considerable arm and hand strength in application and so have proven difficult to apply in mixed sparring - but the heel hook lets women use their considerable leg strength and dexterity to great effect with relatively little interference from males advantages in hand/arm and upper torso strength - as such I have seen more mixed grappling scenarios in the gym over the years won by heel hooks (especially inside heel hooks) than any other by a very considerable margin. Let both women and men take note - when there is a big strength difference heel hooks are among your best friends!

"The mind does its best work when the heart is cold - that‚Äôs when you can think and calculate with the least interference from your passions - and when the mind works quickly and you‚Äôve done your physical work and preparation on the mat - the body will follow with equal speed.

"You can‚Äôt learn all the details in a day. Furthermore, the addition of a single detail is easy enough to learn in theory in less than a minute, but to build it into a skill that you can employ under extreme pressure in live training and competition may take months. So take your time with details. Build them slowly and methodically into your mind first and body second. They really will make a difference to your performance - but not today so much as further out into your tomorrows.

"On the road again: Flying out to Bangkok, Thailand for Garry Tonon‚Äôs upcoming MMA bout for @onechampionship against the very tough Russian Shamil Gasanov. Mr Gasanov is an excellent wrestler and grappler and combines this well with robust striking - he is undefeated in MMA and defeated one of the highest ranked athletes in OneChampionship in his debut! He is an excellent exponent of the Sambo/wrestling/kickboxing synthesis that has proven so effective for Caucasus Russian fighters. It‚Äôs a long flight! But growing up in New Zealand gets one used to that! Looking forward to getting back to Thailand - there is a martial arts spirit and pedigree there that is unrivaled. Trading in the dry heat of Texas for the humidity of South East Asia! I‚Äôm looking forward to it
"
"It‚Äôs not so much a game of making yourself faster and stronger than the other guy, so much as it‚Äôs a game of using restraints and broken posture to make the other guy weaker and slower than yourself. Strong men can be made weak by forcing them into unnatural and broken postures. Fast men can be rendered slow by restraints and obstacles. In Jiu jitsu, as much as we extol gaining strength for ourselves, we venerate robbing an opponent of strength even more.
"
"It‚Äôs good to chase after perfection with all your moves - that will greatly benefit your long term progress - but don‚Äôt let your current lack of perfection hold you back. Remember that with the execution of any move you don‚Äôt need perfection to succeed - you only need to execute it better than the athlete in front of you can defend it.
"
"Why Gordon Ryan is the best no gi mount player I ever saw: Jiu jitsu is a game of position above all. At the top of the heap of the various positions are the mounts - front and rear. They both score the maximum points and you can argue as to which is the better of the two (in grappling I generally prefer rear mount over mount) but one thing is sure - they are both damn good. Of all the myriad athletes I have see over the years the two best practitioners of the mounted position by a landslide were Gordon Ryan (no gi) and Roger Gracie (gi). It is worth asking asking - what makes Gordon Ryan‚Äôs no gi mount game so much better? The position seems pretty simple on the face of it. There aren‚Äôt that many moves from there and most athletes know those moves by the time they‚Äôre blue or purple belts. Lots of people get to the position, so what makes Mr Ryan different? Well I could list quite a few features, but I want to focus on the most important feature - the use of the LEGS as the primary connection and control mechanism of the position. When most people get mounted they immediately focus their attention on the upper body. They fixate on chest to chest contact and connection through a crossface. This is fine, certainly these things can be very important, but never as important as what‚Äôs going on downstairs at the legs. The primary connection is through your legs. You have many choices as to how that connection is held. Each choice will make in you strong in some ways, weak in others. Each choice will have important ramifications for how an opponent can escape and how you can shut down those escapes. Each choice will facilitate certain types of submission attacks and rule out others. Never lose track of the fact that the mount is just a guard position upside down and guard is just an inverted mount. Just as your LEGS are the basis of connection and control from guard - so must they be from mount. Just as you play with many alternative foot positions from guard, so must you do from mount. Just as you must get angle and head control with your legs from guard, so must you do from mount. This lower body focus must be your goal from mount
"
"Speed: Speed is a wonderful attribute to have in any combat sport. If you can consistently get to where you want to be faster than your opponent can get to where he wants to be, you‚Äôll have a definite advantage. However, as desirable as physical speed may be, it‚Äôs value is dwarfed by another form of speed - SPEED OF DECISION MAKING. If you are physically slower than your opponent, the only way you can win a race with them is to START FIRST, and that is exactly what superior speed of decision making enables you to do. If you make a decision to move in a given way prior to your opponent and act on it before he even has decided on his own course of action, then you can realistically get to where you want to be before he does - despite being slower in a physical sense. Remember always that in a fight the race does not go to the swiftest, but to the one that starts first. Make decisions faster than opponents and you‚Äôll always be first off the line

"Getting ready: This Sunday night in Houston Texas, Gordon Ryan will take in the formidable Brazilian world champion grappler Patrick Gaudio at the WNO Grappling event on @flograppling These two titans met before in an epic match at the IBJJF No Gi World Championships - it was a very tightly contested affair - Mr Guadio fought brilliantly that day and with limited time left on the clock he was ahead on points and seemingly heading towards a dramatic victory - with less than a minute left, Gordon Ryan turned it around and scored just enough in the closing seconds to take a very narrow win! Now the two will meet again, this time in a very different rule set and a longer match. Both athletes have changed a lot since their last meeting so there is definitely an element of the unknown going into this. Mr Ryan is coming back after some serious relapses with his stomach issues but has trained well in preparation for what should be a great rematch. Mr Guadio is a powerfully built athlete with legendary strength and explosiveness- he used that very well in the last match to explode up from bottom position and score on Mr Ryan - something very few of his opponents have been able to do. There are many other great great matches on that night also - it feature two mini tournaments at 170 and 155 pounds featuring some of the best competitors in the world - this should be a great show!

"Thank you: Over twenty five years I have taught out of the dojo of my teacher Renzo Gracie. I have been blessed to have so many extraordinary students. I began teaching introduction classes as a blue belt, never dreaming that it would one day be my livelihood. In time I began teaching full time and was fascinated by the overlap of Jiu jitsu with MMA. As fate would have it, a young Georges St Pierre became my student and this began a decade of study in that area culminating in Mr St Pierre as one of the most dominant champions in history and Chris Weidman defeating the other great champion of that era, Anderson Silva. When Georges retired I shifted focus to no gi Jiu jitsu. Once again fate blessed me with outstanding students as Garry Tonon, Eddie Cummings and the Ryan brothers, Gordon and Nicky formed a core of grapplers that changed the game. Through all of that development were my daily students - the core of my classes - far too many to name but you all know who you are. You were my rock and my foundation. Without you all neither myself nor my more well known students could have done what they did. Thank you all so much for your dedication and sacrifices over a quarter of a century. Thank you for tolerating my shortcomings as a person and a teacher. Thank you for making a room in which ideas could be tested, theories spawned and champions made. We all remember training days before Georges fights or ADCC camps averaging over a hundred people on the mats in morning and afternoon class - today it‚Äôs an empty room that i look but my memories will last as long as I do. Thank you for those memories - without you they never would have happened.
"
"Should I take notes after class? A question I am often asked is whether it is beneficial to take notes after Jiu jitsu training sessions. My experience is that there is one common goal for all students - the ability to retain and access learned information under the stress of sparring/competition - however different people have different ways of accomplishing that common goal and no one method appears to outperform the others. For example, Gordon Ryan, Garry Tonon and Nicky Ryan have never taken a note in their lives. Myself and Eddie Cummings were prolific note takers. All of us were able to retain information successfully despite the polar opposite approach with regards notes. What I generally find is that people from an academic background are used to the idea of note taking already and adapt it well to Jiu Jitsu study. Those who are not don‚Äôt. Just do what you‚Äôre comfortable with. Experiment with both and see if there is a difference in your retention performance, but don‚Äôt feel you HAVE to take notes. If you do choose to take notes, focus on writing down what was new and interesting in that session rather than every detail. Remember that our memory has very finite limits so don‚Äôt overstock on non essentials. So if you‚Äôve never taken notes, give it a try, but if you don‚Äôt feel any retention benefits don‚Äôt feel you have to do it or that you are at a disadvantage - you are in good company because most champions don‚Äôt take notes either. But if you feel like it does help (as it probably did when you were in college) - then stick with it with a focus on what was new and important for that day rather than a record of everything that happened.

"Your legs are your life line: This sport is all about how to use your legs to control your opponent. Your legs are the strongest strongest element of your body and have the best endurance. If you can develop your coordination and flexibility in your legs the strength and endurance are already there. When you can use your legs as confidently as your arms and your feet as confidently as your hands - you‚Äôll be a very difficult person to defeat on the mat!
"
"Height: Winning a battle for height will often prove to be of the greatest importance in certain situations in Jiu jitsu. Sometimes you win by getting higher and on top of an opponent - sometimes you win by getting lower and underneath the center of gravity of an opponent - which one you choose will be dependent on what you‚Äôre trying to achieve and what your opponent presents to you. What won‚Äôt change however, is the need to threaten both against good opponents. Fake going high and then dive underneath - or threaten going under and then quickly pop up on top. It‚Äôs the dual threat that always does best!!
"
"Happy New Year!!! Wishing all of you a great 2022!! Set your goals high. Make a realistic and flexible plan to attain them. Divide your goals into short, Medium and long term. Work hard to reach them, don‚Äôt get despondent if you don‚Äôt - keep plugging away and make adjustments when necessary. Play a line between desire and patience and in time what seemed difficult will become easy and maybe what seemed impossible will be a stepping stone to an even more ambitious goal. Most of all - let happiness enter whenever it can and make that journey of yours a pleasant one!
"
"Back up buddy: There are many ways to get hurt in combat sports but one of the most unnecessary comes in situations where two athletes are sparring in a crowded room and crash into another couple of athletes sparring next to them. This kind of incident is usually dismissed as part of the game and laughed off. I never took this approach. In the heyday of the blue basement when Georges St Pierre was getting ready for a big MMA show or the squad was getting ready for ADCC we would often have well over a hundred people working out in a class. In this type of situation it is absolutely crucial that everyone in the room have a good sense of where they are on the mat relative to the people around them. Nothing is more frustrating than an athlete getting ready for a show and getting injured with a cut from a elbow or a joint injury from someone rolling into their arm or leg at an inopportune  time - I have myself been knocked out cold twice from heel kicks to the back of the head while sparring next to athletes whose enthusiasm exceeded their sense of distancing. When you start getting close to other people - make a point of quickly and fluidly rolling away from them and start where you left off. Keep a sense of your surroundings. I teach this in terms of self defense training - just as tunnel vision can be a very dangerous thing in self defense scenarios, so too it can be dangerous in a crowded training room. Train yourself to pay attention as you grapple in training and it will help you pay attention to your surroundings if you have to defend yourself outside the dojo. There are more than enough ways in Jiu jitsu to get injured without adding this easily avoided method to the list. Students - be the one who keeps awareness of your surroundings and does not injure or annoy those around you. Teachers - run a tight ship. Make students aware of the potential danger of collision and build a culture in your dojo that takes pride in being professional and courteous and I promise you your  injury rate will drop and class camaraderie will increase.
"
"Sweeps can do more than sweep: When we go to sweep an opponent from guard position we typically do so with the goal of getting up to to top position and scoring two points. Understand however, that sweeps have TWO major functions. The first is exactly what we just described - the attempt to put an opponent down to bottom position and gain top position. The second is much less talked about. A failed sweep almost always creates SPACE and EXTENSION in our opponent. Space, because he will need to move away to break connection and lessen the power of the sweep; and extension because he will need to base his hands/feet outwards to prevent being turned over. These defensive reactions of space and extension will make it surprisingly easy to switch from the goal of REVERSING an opponent to SUBMITTING an opponent (or standing up to your feet). As the opponent bases out wide with feet and knees - leg lock entries become easy. As he bases out with hands, arm locks and triangles become surprisingly easy. Here, Georges St Pierre is getting ready to test the strong base of Gordon Ryan with a shoulder crunch variation of sumi gaeshi sweep. Mr Ryan is already starting to widen his base in anticipation - ask yourself where you would go with regards submissions in this situation
"
"Leverage and the spine: The spine is the longest lever in the human body. It can be used a a great benefit in countless moves and situations - and it can be used AGAINST you in just as many. If you can control both ends of the lever - your opponents hips and head - you will have gained a very significant mechanical advantage over your opponent. Look at how Gordon Ryan traps his opponents head between his under hook and his own head, whilst simultaneously blocking the hips with his right knee. Control of both ends of the spine like this almost guarantees the guard pass. Controlling one end of the lever is good - controlling both ends is great. Look for this whenever you can - it doesn‚Äôt always come easy, but when it does, you will be unstoppable
"
"The wisdom of the old masters: The old masters of Japan who laid the foundations of our sport always said that the first skill one needed to learn was ukemi - the skill of falling safely to prevent self injury during training. In modern jiu jitsu most of the action is on the floor so ukemi tends to be undervalued. Still, the same idea holds true. The first concern you must always address is avoiding needless self injury. So learning to tap early to submissions, learning to relax your body to give way to force rather than confront it head on every time, learning the correct body postures to keep yourself safe under heavy physical pressure, these are all truly essential skills. Remember always that the number one reason for extended time off the mat and detailed training programs is injury - so learning the essential skills of lowering risk of self injury is a big part of continued progress over time. Just as every doctor begins his career with the adage ‚Äúfirst, so no harm,‚Äù so too the jiu jitsu player must begin his career with the adage ‚Äúfirst, avoid self harm‚Äù and learn the simple but vital skills of physical self preservation on the mat
"
"In Jiu jitsu and in life - you won‚Äôt be measured by how many techniques you know in theory , but rather but how many you are willing to use under stress. If you have a working knowledge of a hundred moves in the comfort of gym sparring, you can probably count on around ten of them being moves you‚Äôre willing to employ under great stress in competition or against a very tough opponent in very competitive sparring. Just as you may know one hundred people, but when push comes to shove, only ten of them are real friends who‚Äôll help you when you‚Äôre in need, so too with your jiu jitsu - those moves that form the bedrock of your game, moves that you‚Äôre willing to use in your toughest and most competitive matches - THOSE are the moves that will define your game. Research them deeply, practice them unceasingly and trust in them completely

"Victory in Texas!! Craig Jones and Gordon Ryan both won brilliant submission victories against very tough opponents tonight here in Austin Texas. Gordon Ryan took on the very talented Roberto Jim√©nez. He expressed a desire in training to avoid using leg locks and focus on arm bar from mount as the means to victory. He released an early leg lock and focused on passing to mount and juji gatame arm-bars. His first attempt was close but Mr Jim√©nez escapes brilliantly under pressure. The second attempt however was devastating and secured the win. Craig Jones took on the brilliant ATOS emerging star Ronaldo Jr. Both men went immediately to their strengths, Craig Jones with his extremely dangerous open guard and Ronaldo Jr with his speedy passing skills. After some strong exchanges Mr Jones latched on to an ashi garami and converted to  a 50/50 variation. After a brief fight for hand control and heel exposure Mr Jones got into a powerful breaking position and won another great victory. Both athletes showed their incredible mastery of the squad ideal of control that leads to submission. Now it‚Äôs time to return to Puerto Rico and get everyone ready for new challenges! Hope you all enjoyed the show!

"Getting under your opponents center of gravity is good. Getting out to an angle is good. Getting both angle and under the center of gravity together is even better! We‚Äôre always looking for advantage in Jiu jitsu. Getting one form of advantage is good - getting two or three together will make you unstoppable. Don‚Äôt be satisfied with some degree of advantage. Once you gain one form of advantage it is usually quite easily to compound its effects by snatching a second or third form of advantage. When you are matched with the toughest opponents in the room, you‚Äôll need every form of advantage you can get, so get greedy with advantage and take every form of it you can! Grip, balance, position, elevation, angle, are all a form of advantage. Each one is an ace in your hand of grappling cards - the more aces you hold - the more likely you‚Äôll break through!
"
"What‚Äôs more important - heuristics or details? When it‚Äôs time to gain knowledge in Jiu jitsu that improves performance there are two main avenues. The first is HEURISTICS. These are general rules of thumb that guide behavior. So for example, ‚Äúwhenever possible try to pass guard in a direction opposite that which your opponents knees are pointing‚Äù is a general piece of advice that guides guard passing behavior in a wide set of circumstances and generally aids guard passing performance. It is easy to remember and gives good guidance in many situations. The second are technical DETAILS. These are situation specific and often difficult to remember under stress. In truth you need both. HEURISTICS WITHOUT DETAILS ARE INEFFECTIVE AND DETAILS WITHOUT HEURISTICS ARE PARALYZING. Make sure your study and general reflections on Jiu jitsu involve both

"Congratulations to my good friend Bernardo Faria for being inducted into the IBJJF Hall of Fame this weekend during the World Championships in California. Bernardo was one of the finest jiu jitsu athletes of his generation and has since gone on to become a cofounder of @bjj.fanatics the jiu jitsu instructional video that I work for. Mr Faria has done what very few have succeeded in doing - in the splintered and tribal world of jiu jitsu he gained near universal respect and trust and unified every corner of jiu jitsu into his company to revolutionize learning in the internet Information Age. Developing athletes now can get the cutting edge technique from the best athletes from every camp and school. I believe that the next few generations of athletes will far surpass the level of current athletes due to this incredible information advantage over previous generations. As an athlete Mr Faria represented himself and his school with great distinction, but now he represents all of jiu jitsu in bringing together all the best players and coaches to benefit the sport as a whole. Here I am with Mr Faria and his co founder, Michael Zenga after watching @bjj.fanatics athlete @nicholasmeregali win the gold medal in the Open Weight Division - a great moment for all of us. Congratulations Bernardo - it‚Äôs been a huge honor üòúüòú to work with you. Thank you for helping my students so much and so many other great athletes and coaches with your work!
"
"Extension: The essential feature of successful submission attempts is always extension of the limb being attacked away from the torso to a degree that renders it vulnerable. The hardest people to submit are those who contract their limbs in tight to the torso (though by doing so they render themselves vulnerable to other methods of attack). When it‚Äôs time to lock joints or strangle necks - extension is the ingredient you need. Extended limbs don‚Äôt stay extended for long in a competitive match - so once you see it - trap it in place. Here, Nicky Ryan latches on to an extended arm in a way that will make extraction difficult and as a result he has a number of great submission opportunities in front of him. Now it‚Äôs time to make a decision as to which option he will take - that of course, is up to you - we all have our favorites - but the one commonality between all those choices will be prior extension of the limb - focus on that first.
"
"Staying compact: This is a sport that generally punishes extension. In general you‚Äôre better off in most situations keeping your elbows and knees close to your core and to each other. If you just work with this simple desiderata in mind - KEEP YOUR ELBOWS AND KNEES CLOSE TOGETHER AND CLOSE TO YOUR BODY - you‚Äôll do better on the mats. As you grow in sophistication you‚Äôll add the idea of inside positioning but that‚Äôs a longer story for a another day. Stay compact and you‚Äôll stay alive - stay alive and you‚Äôre always in the fight!
"
"The other fellow: Many years ago I was in a UFC warm up room getting an athlete ready for competition. As the athletes get ready with exercises and drills they get their hands wrapped by the professionals. It‚Äôs fascinating watching a good hand wrapper go to work. They wrap with a precision that makes your hands feel like two steel encased weapons of war. As the wraps were being applied a young athlete was noisily expressing his approval and delight as his hands were encased in gauze and cotton. ‚ÄúMan! My hands feel like two bricks! Anything I hit I will go right through!‚Äù He stood up upon completion and smashed one hand into his other and growled as he felt the heavy power the wraps gave him. ‚ÄúI could punch a hole in the wall now! If I hit him with these - he‚Äôs sleeping!! I feel like a damn super hero!‚Äù The hand wrapper looked at him and quietly said, ‚Äúvery good - just remember that right now in another room your opponent is getting his hands wrapped the same way.‚Äù There was a quiet pause as the room reflected on the truth of those words. The athlete went silent and sat down with a reflective look of concern - the euphoria and confidence gone. Don‚Äôt put your confidence in things that your opponent has too. You may be strong - so is your opponent. You may be fast - so is your opponent. You may be confident - so is your opponent. Put your faith in the things that you can build to a degree that others don‚Äôt possess at your level - the things that training can create that separate you from others - your technique, tactics and preparation.
"
"Tunnel vision: One of the biggest detractors from performance improvement in grappling is tunnel vision. We all have a tendency to get fixated on one course of action and become blind to other possibilities that are right there in front of us - but as in life - if you can RECOGNIZE possibility you can ACT on it. This one important sense in which combat sports are a mental game - every action begins as an idea/possibility in the mind - when that is absent, no physical action will be taken. Make sure in all your major attacking positions you have three or four major options that you work with on a regular basis so that you don‚Äôt become overly enamored of one and fall into a one track mind. Here, Gordon Ryan, master of strangles from the back, shows versatility in a switch that could lead into juji gatame arm bars and rear triangles (ushiro sankaku), or indeed, an entire shift of position into mount - so that an opponent has to defend against a much wider spectrum of attacks
"
"Routine: When most people say that a person lives a life of routine they mean it in a mildly derogatory way to describe a boring person. It‚Äôs usually seen a bad way to live one‚Äôs life. I have no idea what the best way to live one‚Äôs life is - but I can tell you this with great confidence - if you want to build skills that can make you great at some activity - you will need to live a life dominated by routine. Building skills is all about consistency over time. Constant big swings and chaos in your life won‚Äôt allow this. You need structure in your life that allows you devote large amounts of time daily to skill acquisition with as few interruptions as possible - that means a life of routine. If your vision of life is bound up with learning skills that make you excel at some activity - you‚Äôll need to live a life of routine long enough to develop those skills. Routine may be a dirty word to some, but it‚Äôs the path to greatness to those whose future is bound up with skill acquisition.

"Looking forward to Texas! This Saturday night in Austin Texas will be one of the biggest grappling events of the year - The Road To ADCC, a grappling super fight event using ADCC world championships rule set featuring the biggest names in the sport! Nicky Ryan will take on one of the toughest men on modern grappling - Dante Leon. Mr Leon shocked the grappling world at the last world championships by defeating one of the greatest grapplers of the modern era - double ADCC silver medalist Lucas Lepri. Now he will face a Nicky Ryan in what is unquestionably the biggest test of the squad youngster so far! The show will use the special rules of ADCC finals matches - twenty minutes with any guard pulling subject to penalty - so there will be a lot of standing grappling alongside the ground work. Craig Jones was expected to headline with a match against ATOS superstar Lucas Barbosa but sadly he broke a bone in his hand during takedown practice and had to withdraw. The event is packed with great athletes. I can‚Äôt wait to see main event - the great Kaynan Duarte, unquestionably one of the greatest grapplers on the planet, against Matheus Diniz, a master tactician who fears no one and who has the physicality required for such a huge match up! The brilliant technician Michael Musimici will take on the mentally tough and athletically gifted Geo Martinez in a match up contrasting two polar opposite approaches to Jiu jitsu - this should be a tremendous match! There are other great matches as well! Gordon Ryan, myself and other squad members will teach a big seminar the night before on Friday and show the squad philosophy of Jiu jitsu - can‚Äôt wait to see you all there and get back to Austin!! Keep your night open to see all these superstars in action!

"The greatest positions in Jiu jitsu - mount and rear mount: The game of Jiu jitsu rewards the mount and rear mount with more points than any other positional moves. I fact they score twice as much as takedowns, sweeps, knee on stomach and even outscore guard passing. As much as possible you should seek to get to these high reward positions. It‚Äôs a fascinating question which is is the better of the two. I generally put a premium on back over mount in grappling but slightly favor the mount in fighting when striking is involved. The real point is not however, which is better, but rather, how will you move smoothly from one to the other. Both positions involve the use of your legs wrapped around your opponents hips or torso to exert control. WHENEVER AN OPPONENT TURNS OUT OF ONE POSITION HE WILL OFFER OPPORTUNITY TO TRANSITION TO THE OTHER. Learning to take advantage of this transition from mount to rear mount and rear mount to mount is key to your development in utilizing these devastating positions to maximum advantage. Understand that when an opponent goes to turn you want to HELP them by opening a little space with your legs. Look at how Gordon Ryan lifts his knee to let an opponent turn inside and go easily from mount to rear mount. He does this without losing upper body pressure - that‚Äôs important because it‚Äôs that pressure which motivates an opponent to turn in the first place. Jiu jitsu rewards these two positions more than any other - make sure you learn to move between them to reap those rewards to the greatest degree possible!

"Outstanding!! The ADCC North American trials have been on this weekend with many amazing performances from the athletes across all weight divisions. Among those great performances were two that have a remarkable element that pertains to many of my readers. I teach my instructional videos at BJJ Fanatics in Boston and two of the main demonstrations partners I work with are Placido Santos and Giancarlo Bodoni, both of who regularly appear in my videos. Over the years they have diligently worked on the material we cover and often travel long distances for extended periods of time to come to train with us. Giancarlo recently moved to Austin to train with us full time. That dedication paid off with both men having outstanding performances in the trials. Giancarlo won Gold in his division and punched his ticket to the biggest event in grappling - the next ADCC world championships next year. He won against the biggest field in trials history over two grueling days. Placido came out guns blazing on the first two with a spectacular run of submissions - both men had a very high submission rate. It‚Äôs amazing to see the transformation that new knowledge and new ways of thinking can have on a self motivated and dedicated student who puts in the work necessary to transform knowledge into skill. I am so proud of their performances and the way they showed how long distance learning can have a powerful effect on your Jiu jitsu game. Thank you also to Gordon Ryan who did a very fine job of cornering both athletes - his experience in ADCC competition is such a help. Thank you also to BJJ Fanatics Bernardo Faria and Micheal Zenga, who came to watch their two most famous employees put on the best performance of their lives this weekend! Well done Giancarlo and Placido!

"It‚Äôs been a pleasure hosting the very talented Jacob Couch @thehillbillyhammer who has been training with us the last two weeks in preparation for the upcoming Arizona ADCC Open this weekend. Everyone knows how good this fellow is at Jiu jitsu - we learned this week he‚Äôs also a great character and one of the funniest people to have in the room. My favorite story was when he convinced the people at @flograppling that as a hillbilly he is unable to read or write and therefore couldn‚Äôt sign a contract - I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs better - the fact that he said it or the fact that they believed it! üòÇüòÇüòÇ It was great having him here - now the competition is getting close so everyone will be heading to Arizona for what should be another great ADCC event with over a thousand competitors signed up!

"Even when in defense - train your mind to look for counter offense. If your mind is preoccupied only defending a move you make yourself an annoyance to an opponent - but to excel you must go beyond being an annoyance and become a THREAT - that means carrying the spirit of offense within you at all times - even in defense. When the mind is trained to look, it will see. Seeing offense on a defenseless opponent is easy, but seeing it even on tough, aggressive and attacking opponents is the ideal you must strive for
"
"Stripping away choice: The essential nature of Jiu jitsu can be explained very easily. At the onset of a match both athletes can move as they please. As a result they each have many thousands of options as to what they may do. The second they come to grips that number of options drops dramatically as now they have to move in ways that account for the grip and control of their opponent. As one athlete gains increasing dominance in position the number of sensible options for the other athletes diminishes further still. As the positions and grips become still more dominant those available options for the defensive athletes fall down to less than a dozen. By the time a real finishing hold has been achieved the options can be counted on one hand. Your goal is always to reduce the infinite number of available options at the onset of the match to two options that signals the end of the match - submission or the physical consequences of refusal to submit. Starting to see the game as a the battle to reduce an opponents options is a big part of your development. This is the mindset that enables you to see an opponents future actions - not because you have some superpower to see the future, but simply because you know the limited options he will have available ahead of time.
"
"Speed: Speed is a wonderful attribute in most combat sports but in a predominantly ground grappling sport like jiu jitsu speed becomes a little more nuanced  for the simple reason that you usually can‚Äôt really move very quickly on the floor. Rather than try to make yourself faster - take a different approach - instead of trying to make yourself faster focus on making your opponent slower. Remember - there are always TWO ways to win a race. You can make yourself faster or you can make the other guy slower. In truth, it is the second option that is generally preferable in Jiu jitsu. Speed is largely determined by genetics  and decreases with age. Slowing someone down through grip and positioning is determined by skill and is the way of longevity. There are some scenarios in Jiu jitsu where speed is an important asset - many takedowns in standing position, toreando passing are good examples. However, if you have close body contact with an opponent on the floor, the ability to slow the other fellow down will typically prove more important than the ability to speed yourself up
"
"First contact - hands or feet? Grappling is all about connection. No connection to an opponent means no grappling.  At some you have to come to grips to make the action start. When you first come to make grips from open guard you have a choice between feet and hands. In truth, much of that choice will be determined by your opponent. If he positions himself in certain ways - hands will make more sense - in others - feet will make more sense. When ever he denies you one, the other will be available. Generally in no gi you will initially use your feet to establish contact at the ankles and knees. Hands at the wrists, elbows and collar. Here, Nicky Ryan uses feet first due to distance and stance - use that first contact to read the opponent and move into establish  more contact for greater control. Just as you test water with a single hand or foot before jumping in, so too, test an opponent with a single hand or foot before jumping in to full connection.
"
"There are many ways to win in Jiu jitsu, but the single most high percentage, safest, most effective across weight classes, best against bigger/stronger opponents, gi or no gi, grappling or fighting - is to get behind them and strangle them - end of story
"
"Angle is everything: It‚Äôs hard to make frontal assaults in this game. All your opponents best defenses are directly in front of him. Seek always to get a preliminary angle - it doesn‚Äôt have to be a big angle - even small angular change makes a noticeable difference. Angle will often shorten the distance to a target, get you outside their main defenses, or force them to adjust their position in ways that let you catch them on the hop before their stance is reset. Don‚Äôt just step in. Step out to an angle first and THEN step in - make this a habit and you‚Äôll be much more successful at much less cost.
"
"Victory in Costa Mesa! Outstanding juniors Daniel Manasoiu @jiujitsugiant Davis Asare @davis_asare and Helena Crevar @helenajiujitsugirl all won gold at the big ADCC Open grappling event in Costa Mesa yesterday! Daniel won double gold - weight and absolute division. Helena also win double gold - adult - 65kg and teenage division (she just turned sixteen but often competes in adult divisions as well. Davis won -83 kg division. All three had extraordinarily high submission percentage. They have all been training very hard and got to showcase their rapidly growing skills on the west coast! Congratulations! ü§óü§ó

"A day to say goodbye: Today was the funeral for Big Gord. It was a day to remember the father who raised two strong grapplers, who gave what he had to see his sons pursue their dreams; who took greater pleasure in their successes than anything in his own life. He was a character who quietly suffered through great physical pains from more than twenty surgeries over his life and some private demons in his soul, but who nonetheless faced every dawn with resolve to help his family and friends any way he could. He was taken peacefully in his sleep secure in the knowledge that he was loved by those around him and that his sons had climbed to the top of their profession despite many disadvantages early in their lives. Tonight we will talk old stories and laugh and cry and then get set for a new day and a chance to give him more reason to be proud out into the future.
"
"Top position in Jiu jitsu is a constant battle to get past the feet, legs and hips and get up to the head and shoulders. It doesn‚Äôt matter whether you‚Äôre in front of him or behind him - the classic positional battle of Jiu jitsu ends with control of the head and shoulders. This simple imperative gives you a sense of direction - a positional pole star that always makes it clear where you need to be headed at any moment. In a complex world of grappling moves it gives a simple vision that will always hold true
"
"Using gravity from underneath: One of the most common beliefs in grappling is that the top athlete always has gravity working in his favor against the bottom athlete. In fact the bottom athlete also has gravity working for him - JUST IN A DIFFERENT WAY. The top athlete gets to use gravity in his favor as a means to make an opponent CARRY HIS WEIGHT. The bottom athlete gets to use gravity in his favor by BREAKING HIS OPPONENTS BALANCE SO THAT TOP ATHLETE STUMBLES AND LOSES THE INTEGRITY OF HIS STANCE. As the bottom athlete you can use gravity just as effectively as the top player by CONSTANTLY FORCING HIS CENTER OF GRAVITY BEYOND HIS BASE OF SUPPORT. Every time you do this you will break his stance and force him to immediately focus on recovery. Do this many times over a match and you‚Äôll exhaust even the fittest opponents. Combine it with sweeps and submissions and you‚Äôll rack up a landslide of points and submit a lot of people. Never forget - you BOTH have gravity working in your favor. Victory will go to the athlete who uses it appropriately from whatever position you currently occupy
"
"When you‚Äôre the more experienced or bigger partner - start in bottom position with disadvantage: We all have a wide variety of training partners. Inevitably there will be big variations in size and skill level among them - so don‚Äôt treat them all the same. When you are more experienced or bigger - don‚Äôt start neutral as you would for someone your own size or skill level - start with some form of disadvantage so you get more out of the session and work skills you might not otherwise work and at the same time make it more competitive. When you do this you can be in a room full of small white belts and still get a good workout. It‚Äôs not about who you beat in the gym - it‚Äôs about beating who you were yesterday - and starting with disadvantage is the best way to do this when training with people you already know you can easily beat.
"
"The basis of our open guard game - the hook sweep (sumi gaeshi): The most versatile and effective sweep from open guard whenever an opponent is on their knees is, in my opinion, the hook sweep sumi gaeshi. It takes very little athletic ability, works both against and for all body types, and if the sweep should fail it leads directly into devastating leg locks since it is based on inside control. It can be done from almost any grip, it is easy to perform on both sides and you can switch rapidly from one side to another. There aren‚Äôt many moves that I demand my students get good at - generally I try to encourage students to make their own choices - but sumi gaeshi is one of them. All of my senior students excel at it - you should too!
"
"Getting ready for the show! Luke Griffith @luke_griffithjj has been training hard for his match against rising star Haisam Rida tomorrow night in Dallas with @flograppling Mr Rida had an electrifying performance at the recent ADCC with a powerful submission victory over legend Cyborg Abreau that made him a star performer. Both athletes are progressing quickly, both are tall and athletic, both have a dynamic style aimed at submission - this should be a great match! The card has many other great matches. B team standout Damien Anderson takes on the teenage phenom Cole Abate who impressed everyone at ADCC this year as the youngest athlete. Another B team powerhouse Ethan Crelinsten takes on the brilliant Brazilian grappler Fabricio Andrey in what will surely be a great match with both men possessing great skills, speed and strength. Fan favorite Jacob Couch takes on Bruno Matias in the co main main event of the evening leading into the main event - a match between outstanding ADCC silver medalist Brianna St-Marie and Mayssa Bastos - both women have had an outstanding year of competition and both bring a lot of momentum into the match! Hope you all enjoy the show!
"
"Nothing good happens when you‚Äôre inside a closed guard: In a grappling match, as long as you are locked inside a closed guard there is an undesirable asymmetry insofar you don‚Äôt have any form of offense while your opponent has many attacks that he can employ against you (obviously fighting is a very different story as there are many effective strikes that the top athlete inside the closed guard can employ). As such, you want to spend as little time as possible inside the closed guards of your opponents as possible so that you are not caught on the wrong side of this asymmetry any longer than necessary. As such you MUST develop reliable ways of opening a closed guard in a timely manner so that you don‚Äôt waste long periods of match time in a position from which you cannot advance and score and where he can submit you with many of the best moves in the sport but you have only a few long percentage attacks on him. I strongly prefer standing methods of opening a closed guard and believe that these work best for most people in most situations (though some athletes have specialized methods of opening closed guards on their knees). Learning to stand inside a dangerous closed guard can be rather discouraging at first as you will often be knocked down - don‚Äôt get discouraged - getting knocked down a few times before you succeed is perfectly normal even at world championship level - it‚Äôs not as bad as sitting passively inside a closed guard letting time waste and defending yourself from submissions. Opening a closed guard is one of the first skills you must master if you are to make progress in the sport since without it you couldn‚Äôt even get started in top position. Find a method that suites you and get to work!
"
"Make use of the most distinctive features of Jiu jitsu: There are many distinctive features of Jiu jitsu that separate it from other grappling sports. One that doesn‚Äôt get much attention but which is of the greatest importance is that Jiu jitsu, unlike wrestling, judo and sambo, score CHEST TO BACK pins. In judo, only chest to chest pins where you have passed your opponent legs count. In wrestling only pins that touch your opponents back and shoulders to the floor count. Sambo is similar to judo except that they do allow pins when you have not passed an opponents legs in some circumstances. None of them score rear mount as a pin. In Jiu jitsu the rear mount if the highest scoring position (along with front mount). It score twice as much as a takedown or sweep and more than passing guard. Not only is it the biggest scorer in points, it is also the number one position for submitting opponents. In addition it is the safest position in the sport. There is very little an opponent can do offensively from there. As such, Jiu jitsu athletes put a higher value of getting to the rear mount than anything else in the game. It may not score in other grappling sports - but in Jiu jitsu it is the king position. If your goal is excellence in Jiu jitsu then you must make excellence in taking, maintaining and finishing from rear mount as your number one priority.
"
"In Jiu jitsu - you don‚Äôt have to be the fastest athlete - you just have to be the athlete who gets to the finish line first: Speed is a wonderful thing in combat sports, but not all of us are born fast and even those who are born fast lose speed over the course of a lifetime. The idea is not to value raw speed so much as the ability to get to a goal before your opponent - and there are many ways to do that that don‚Äôt involve speed. One way to create the illusion of speed is to travel less distance in the same time. For example - the basic juji gatame arm bar from guard. If You begin the move with your feet locked at my opponents lower back, that‚Äôs a considerable distance to move your legs and feet all the way up to the head to perform the move. If  instead you slide your locked legs up to your opponents shoulder, then the distance required to transition to the arm bar is massively shortened - creating a much quicker performance of the arm bar even though you are moving at the same speed. In everything you do in Jiu jitsu, ask yourself - is there a way to speed up my performance of this move without speeding up the movements of my body? In most cases the answer is YES. And the act of researching how to do this will make you a better student of the sport.
"
"Interfering hands: It always seems every time you go to hit a move from guard your opponents hands are always working to dislodge the grip of your legs and shit down your sweep attempt. Whenever this happens - attack his balance. If he doesn‚Äôt use his hands for balance he‚Äôll fall. If he does release and use his hands for balance and base - he won‚Äôt be able to interfere with your guard and you can attack again. Don‚Äôt accept those disruptive hands. If he puts hands on your legs - knock him off balance immediately and play off his reaction to it.
"
"If you could have only one finishing hold for the rest of your life - what would it be? For me it would be the rear strangle without question. It is the most reliable finishing hold of all. It does matter how mentally tough the opponent is - a strangle will incapacitate him and end the match. If an initial attempt should fail - you still have the position and can keep trying until you succeed. The position you use it from puts you in a situation where you can attack at will as many times as it takes to get the breakthrough. It requires no special physical characteristics and can definitely be used by smaller people to defeat bigger and stronger people. It works for short people, tall people, thin people and thick people. It works equally well in both grappling and fighting. It is the perfect embodiment of the Jiu jitsu philosophy of position before submission. With this in mind - you owe it to yourself to develop a PERFECT rear strangle. Study it and perfect it. If there is ONE finishing move in the sport that is truly worth perfecting it is this one. Don‚Äôt settle for a decent rear strangle - make yours the very best you can. Life is full of sham products that aren‚Äôt worth the time and effort we put into acquiring them - the rear strangle is a true gem that is worth every second of time and ounce of sweat you put into its development, refinement and perfection - don‚Äôt settle for anything less

"Filming in Boston with old friends: I went up to Boston to film a new instructional video for the NEW WAVE series. It was great to see old friends Bernardo Faria and Placido Santos! It‚Äôs a beautiful New England summer here. I love the fact that in this great country there is so much variation in geography and tradition that in a week going from Puerto Rico to Texas to Massachusetts was like going to three different countries! Now we‚Äôre headed to dinner to talk shop and get ready to film some more. Wishing you all the best from this New England summer to wherever you are
"
"They can‚Äôt all be diamonds: When I was beginning Jiu jitsu one of my most important mentors and training partners was future UFC and IBJJF world champion Matt Serra. Like any beginning student I was always chasing maximum progress in minimum time. There were a few days I would leave the gym ecstatic with the progress I felt I was making and the knowledge I was gaining; but there were many more days I‚Äôd leave thinking I‚Äôd gotten no better, possibly slightly worse, and that I‚Äôd never catch up to the advanced students. Whenever I would have days like this I would vent to Matt and he‚Äôd look at me and say, ‚ÄúHey man, they can‚Äôt all be diamonds!‚Äù It would always raise a smile on my face because I knew even then it was true. Progress in Jiu jitsu isn‚Äôt linear. It tends to happen in short spurts where some critical insight is gained that boosts your performance. In between these short periods of significant progress there are typically long periods of very little, even no discernible progress and occasionally regression (particularly when you‚Äôre trying a lot of new moves and concepts). DON‚ÄôT WORRY - this is the normal state of affairs. Just stay in the game and be sure that the progress will come. Be assured that progress in Jiu jitsu looks a lot like a graph of the stock market over time - lots of chaos in the short term with many big dips and rises but a noticeable overall upward momentum when longer time periods are used to assess it. Remember always that the only thing that definitely WILL stop your progress is stopping training.

"
"Undermining athleticism: One of the central features of Jiu jitsu is the constant drive to UNDERMINE WHATEVER ATHLETIC POTENTIAL YOUR OPPONENT HAS. The human body is constructed in such a way that for every athletic task it is capable of performing, there is an optimal stance or bodily disposition that facilitates that task. Your goal in Jiu jitsu is to interfere with that as much as possible in order to reduce an opponent to a klutzy, tied up and useless, unathletic specimen waiting to be submitted. There are many ways to do this depending upon the situation you are in. When it comes to leg locking, arguably the most controlling means of shackling an opponent up in a manner that severely undermines his athleticism is to lace his ankles whilst holding him in cross ashi garami. That immediately prevents an opponent standing up, coming forward or scooting back and also makes turning difficult. ONCE YOU CONTROL MOVEMENT - YOU CONTROL THE GAME. Research how to restrain people and undermine their athleticism in your favorite finishing holds and watch your finishes skyrocket
"
"Make it a battle of your legs against your opponents upper body and you will prevail even against bigger opponents and make it look effortless against smaller or same size opponents. An opponent might be considerably bigger and stronger than you overall, but his arms are not bigger and stronger than your legs. Learn to fight his arms with your legs and you will put yourself on a winning track. You can‚Äôt always do it, but when you can it is a truly fine representation of the ideals of Jiu jitsu
"
"Distance control: One of the most important aspects of guard play is CONTROLLING THE DISTANCE BETWEEN YOU AND YOUR OPPONENT. If your opponent is move to move towards and away from you at will - he gets to choose when and how you engage - that‚Äôs a big advantage for the top player. It‚Äôs important you take those luxuries away from him and bestow them on yourself. Controlling distance without a gi can be a challenge as you don‚Äôt have the gi collar to help you. I generally find the best all round method is ashi garami. Your knee positioned in front of him makes it difficult and risky for an opponent to push towards you and also difficult to back away as you have a leg positioned behind him as well. As soon as you control distance it‚Äôs time to attack the opponents balance - and then attack with sweeps and submissions. Start with grip into distance control, then off balancing, then the real attack. Multi tiered approaches like this are what will make your guard a formidable weapon for any opponent
"
"Getting weak: I flew up to Boston today to film a new instructional video for @bjj.fanatics It‚Äôs the first time in two years I‚Äôve been in a New England winter and I‚Äôve totally gotten soft! üòÇüòÇüòÇ After two years of Puerto Rico‚Äôs warm ocean breeze and Texas Dry desert heat I‚Äôm huddled up like a hibernating animal üòÇüòÇüòÇI used to fearlessly step out into the cold for thirty years in NYC. I worked long nights outside nightclubs for a decade in sub zero temperatures. I trained Georges St Pierre in freezing Montreal winters for a decade and never missed a beat - now I‚Äôm crying because it‚Äôs less than 50 degrees üòÇüòÇüòÇ My old NYC students would be ashamed of me! üòÇüòÇüòÇ I better get back to my old self or this will be a long week!! ‚õÑÔ∏è‚ùÑÔ∏è‚õÑÔ∏è‚õ∑‚õ∏‚ò†Ô∏è‚ò†Ô∏è‚ò†Ô∏è It‚Äôs amazing how we accept wherever we are as normal and adapt to that and as soon as we‚Äôre taken from there we are like a fish out of water! üòÇüòÇ Ha! I‚Äôm going to turn up the thermostat!
"
"Relaxation and tension: One of the toughest things to learn on your Jiu jitsu journey is the juxtaposition of RELAXATION and TENSION as you perform Jiu Jitsu. Relaxation is important for ENDURANCE and EFFICIENT SMOOTH MOVEMENT. If you are overly tense you can‚Äôt move well and you‚Äôll fatigue very quickly. On the other hand, isometric tension is important to IMMOBILIZE an opponent in pins and submission holds. If you‚Äôre too relaxed while applying pins and submissions an opponent will simply shrug you off and escape. YOU MUST LEARN TO NAVIGATE BETWEEN THE DEMANDS FOR RELAXATION AND TENSION IN ORDER TO BE EFFECTIVE. One without the other will lead you to failure. Look how Gordon Ryan is transitioning rapidly from his usual relaxed state to one of maximal tension as he enters and progresses through a submission attack. He is placing closed wedges via triangle around his opponents head and arm - he will need great muscular tension against ban opponent of this caliber in order to maintain those wedges in place against tremendous physical resistance. When sparring - keep a good sense of when you need to relax and when you need to tighten up. Use tension only in short bursts when either extreme defensive or offensive demand compels you - and the moment it‚Äôs over, go back to relaxation.
"
"Sometimes when you look at it Jiu jitsu just seems like a hopeless and disorganized tangle of thrashing limbs - but always remember that under that apparent chaos there are TWO THINGS that give Jiu jitsu direction - POSITIONAL DOMINANCE and SUBMISSION. Understand that no matter confusing or complicated it may seem there are only five dominant positions and around fifteen high percentage submissions in the game - as long as you‚Äôre constantly searching and working towards those two end points you will be going forward. Keep your mind on the endgame and your Jiu jitsu will always have direction minute by minute however disorganized and disoriented it might appear second by second.
"
"The stronger your initial attack - the easier your follow up attacks: It‚Äôs rather rare in top level Jiu jitsu to smash through your opponents defenses on the first attempt and get the score. Usually it involves elaborate sets ups, fatiguing pressure over time or combination of moves to get a breakthrough. When it comes to combinations, a weak first attack is unlikely to evoke a sufficient reaction from a talented opponent to set up a good combination. Worse still, it may be strongly countered. You want a powerful first attack that throws your opponent into a totally defensive mindset and evokes predictable defensive reactions that you can capitalize upon. Don‚Äôt hang back from the opening attack even though you know it‚Äôs just a ruse to set up the subsequent attacks - go in hard to create the reactions you need to make the second, third or fourth attack score!
"
"When you first take a student into training, you try to make him see what you see, to think as you think, but ultimately the goal is to make him see more than you ever did and know more than you ever knew.

"Sad to report that Garry Tonon lost his title fight here in Singapore via KO to champion Thanh Le. Garry went early for one of his trademark heel hook attacks. Initially he did a good job turning his opponent and got good early pressure on the joint. Mr Le showed excellent composure and did a good job of turning back into the lock and fired a very accurately placed punch from on top that stunned Garry and then swarmed in with several more to take a fine and decisive victory. The referee did an excellent job of intervening quickly to prevent unnecessary damage. I‚Äôm with Garry now - he is fine physically - we will as always, get back to training, make adjustments and work towards our goals. Thank you as always for your support - now we head back to Texas to start on new challenges
"
"Opportunity won‚Äôt last forever: Jiu jitsu is a game of movement. As the two athletes move around each other, opportunities to attack will naturally arise. No doubt all of you will already have your favorite opportunities. Some of you will favor front headlocks, some kimura, some leg locks from variations of ashi garami; arguably the most effective opportunistic scramble target is the back - whichever one you favor - understand that the opportunity will be fleeting and the better your opponent, the more fleeting it will be. As such, you must build the capacity to PULL THE TRIGGER UPON OPPORTUNITY. You will need to build this disposition in two ways. First, building the skills that lead to success with the move. Second, building the defensive skills that will enable you to recover in cases you you FAIL succeed with the move. Fear of the consequences of failing in the split second of opportunity has stopped more athletes from attempting the move when the opportunity was there than athletes who tried and failed. In a world of fleeting opportunity it‚Äôs not just about the skills that make the move work, but about the confidence to pull the trigger and attempt it - for without the attempt, no amount of skill will be of value in that fleeting time you have to perform the move you seek

"Victory in Texas!! The squad came out strong tonight in Austin, Texas at the WHO‚ÄôS NUMBER ONE grappling show tonight - four athletes competed with four decisive victories! Australian grappling super star Craig Jones showed his stellar development with a near perfect submission victory over great Jiu jitsu world champion Luiz Panza at the very start of his match with a beautifully applied heel hook. Mr Jones has deeply impressed all of us with his progress over the last three years and he showed it publicly here tonight with a flawless victory. Nicky Ryan showed his rapidly developing takedown and passing skills with multiple takedowns and passes to rear mount against the formidable world champion Gabriel Almeida despite the considerable size difference. Oliver Taza took on the brilliant AOJ athlete Johnatha Alves and was able to pass and briefly hold mount and then go into several powerful heel hook attacks. Mr Alves showed great courage to hold out despite the pain but Mr Taza took a decisive victory. Demian Anderson took on 10th Planet standout Luis Quinones. He weathered an early storm with impressive calm for a developing athlete and came back to win by a beautiful stranglehold after some nice positional control. Thanks as always to Garry Tonon and Gordon Ryan for help preparing and coaching the squad for action. Now it‚Äôs back to Boston to film another instructional video and then to Puerto Rico to get everyone ready for the next challenge. Thank you to Joe Rogan for a great podcast chat! Hope you all enjoyed the show!! Good night from Texas!!

"The real power of pinning: In jiu jitsu passing guard into a pin is defined by the act of getting completely past your opponents legs and holding at least one hip and shoulder to the floor for a minimum of three seconds. Most people use pins to score. As a result their is little to no relationship between their pins and their submissions. This is disappointing. The real power of pinning comes from the ability to create EXTREME PRESSURE THAT CREATES OPENINGS THAT LEAD TO SUBMISSIONS. You must seek to create pinning pressure that opponents FEAR. When you can make opponents wilt and fatigue over time under your pins then you will have created the incredibly valuable link between pinning and submission and lived up to the central jiu jitsu theme of position being linked to submission. Good pins attack your opponent on several important fronts simultaneously. Posture, alignment and breathing are the three targets you want to focus on. Degrade those three and you‚Äôll degrade resistance overall and make submissions easy.
"
"Strangles - Gi vs No gi: Strangles, and in particular, back strangles, are the single most devastating weapon in all of Jiu jitsu. Nothing else gives such certainty of success in application whilst maintaining your own safety from counters. Yet the two primary applications, gi and no gi, are very different from each other. In the case of no gi strangles from the back, you must use your head as a blocking wedge close to your opponents head. Your bodies will be aligned and the power of the strangle will come from the rotation of your elbow around his neck. The instrument of strangulation will be your wrist/forearm and bicep. This is rather thick and so often it can be problematic to penetrate under the chin and often requires trapping the opponents defensive arms prior to applying the strangle. In the case of collar strangles, things are very different. Now the instrument of the strangle is the opponents lapel/collar. It has a hard and very thin edge that slices under the jaw/chin like a knife and makes penetration to the strangle far more efficient. The collar/lapel is like a rope around the neck - an extraordinarily effective strangulation implement. In addition, unlike naked strangles, you want to form a perpendicular angle to your opponents shoulders and the power of the strangle comes from your bodyweight hanging off your opponent and your leverage leg pressing over his far shoulder. This puts all your bodyweight and leg strength into a strangle with a cutting rope around the neck - this creates a far greater degree of efficiency strangle than any naked strangle can ever hope to attain. Compare the two body positions in the photos and see the big differences in alignment, leg work and bodyweight application and understand that back strangles with a gi are a very different matter from strangles without one.
"
"Wasted minutes: A minute or two of your time doesn‚Äôt seem like much - unless you‚Äôre in a six minute Jiu jitsu match. In matches less than ten minutes a minute or two is a big deal. It‚Äôs not enough to simply be able to perform moves - you must be able to do so in a timely manner. A good example is sitting inside an opponents closed guard. Time spent inside an opponents closed guard is wasted time. You can score anything there and you can‚Äôt attack with any high percentage submissions from there - but your opponent certainly can! As such you want to spend as little time as possible inside an opponents closed guard - nothing good happens inside there. I find that the most reliable method is to stand up and open the closed guard. It‚Äôs not the only way of doing it but it‚Äôs the best one for smaller and shorter athletes to realistically open a bigger and taller opponents closed guard. It can be done in a short time period and allows you to minimize time spent in a position where you can‚Äôt score but the other guy can - never where you want to be in this game. Next time you‚Äôre in a closed guard don‚Äôt just think of getting out, ask yourself how long it took you to do so.

"Victory in Texas!! The squad had a great night here in Austin tonight with three athletes competing and three victories at The Who‚Äôs Number One grappling show. Gordon Ryan won via submission - a triangle that he selected prior to the match - against the great ADCC medalist and squad rival, Vagner Rocha. Nicky Rod took on the great Yuri Simoes, the two time ADCC gold medalist in two weight categories. Nicky Rod showed his incredible Jiu jitsu development by passing repeatedly against a great champion who is almost never scored on in even the highest level competition. Oliver Taza won a very tightly contested match against outstanding world champion Johnny Tama. Mr Tama played a strong positional game while Mr Taza focused most on submission attacks. It was great being back in Texas and great to see the squad athletes showcase the skills they work so hard to perfect in the gym out on the stage. Now it‚Äôs back to Puerto Rico to get Craig Jones, Nicky Ryan and Ethan Crelinsten ready for big challenges next month!! Hope you all enjoyed the show!!

"Increasing your opportunities by changing your angle or orientation: It‚Äôs very difficult to attack through the front door on a defensively sound opponent. Their entire stance is set up relative to your current position and location to stop you being able to execute any attacks. However, if you were to change the angle or orientation of your body relative to him, then his stance will need to be changed to address the change you‚Äôve made - and in the time he makes that change he will be open to attack. Sometimes it‚Äôs just a matter of getting a small angle on an opponent, other times it‚Äôs about totally changing your body orientation - one of the most common and effective means of doing this is to completely invert your body. This completely changes the relationship between your positioning and his and can open big avenues of attack. Get used to inverting under an opponent - moves that seemed impossible just a few seconds before suddenly become a lot easier
"
"Plotting: one of the great things about grappling martial arts is they often offer you good opportunities to SLOW THINGS DOWN and to THINK ABOUT YOUR NEXT MOVE. In striking martial arts there is usually a much higher pace and very little time to think once you get within striking range. In Jiu jitsu, all the dominant pin positions, rear mount, mount, side and north/south, along with top turtle position, half guard top and bottom and closed guard, enable you to take a breather and consider your next line of attack. Learn to use these positions as more than physical advantage, but also as a means to gain TACTICAL ADVANTAGE through the use of plotting a next move. Here, Gordon Ryan has worked himself to top turtle position - a good one for taking some time to consider the next options

"A lesson from a young blue belt: I think it‚Äôs fair to see we all enter this sport with a lot of self doubt. Your first few years is just a long story of getting your ass kicked every day at the dojo. As a result it‚Äôs natural to wonder if you‚Äôll ever be any good, if you‚Äôll ever be able to match the people currently crushing you, whether as a blue belt you‚Äôll ever be able to take on the upper belts. This weekend talented young Daniel Manasoiu, a nineteen year old blue belt went to The European Open, where Europe‚Äôs best get together to battle it out no gi under ADCC rules. Most of the athletes are very experienced brown and black belts. Big Dan won double gold, both his weight division and absolute with his devastating submissions game - specializing of course in leg locks. I have always been impressed by the incredible sporting heritage and success of the Eastern European nations. I believe one day they will be a powerful force in the world of grappling. Big Dan is American but first generation Romanian so he was very proud to go back to his roots and take double gold. It is a great lesson for all of us. That if you train hard, you can overcome higher belts and more experienced opponents who have been in the sport much longer. The only thing that counts on the mat is your skills, and if you work hard and intelligently, you can grow those faster than many people believe, so that your current doubts can be replaced by future triumphs. Well done Dan!
"
"Never forget that ninety percent of the outcome of a bout is determined before the athletes even step on to the mat. Focus most of your energy on PREPARATION rather than the bout itself and the results you seek will generally follow as naturally as night follows day.

"Seeing it is half the battle: A move is a physical skill, but physical skills don‚Äôt tell the whole story of who gets to use the move successfully in a live situation. You can have all the skills in the world, but if you can‚Äôt see the opportunity for their application they are of little value. Fortunately, the task of identifying opportunities is pretty easy in most cases. For example it doesn‚Äôt take a rocket scientist to figure out the opportunity to use a mount escape move is when you‚Äôre mounted. Things get more interesting however, when you start looking at the notion of single move being used in many different areas. Then you have to start FORCING opportunities and seeing possibilities where most people don‚Äôt see them at all. There‚Äôs an old saying that to a man with a hammer in his hand, everything looks like a nail. So too in jiu jitsu, when you have a very strong move, your mind will see opportunities for its use in damn near any situation. The best overall application of this kind of thinking is TAKING YOUR OPPONENTS BACK. This is truly a valuable and winning skill in jiu jitsu and can done from anywhere if you‚Äôre creative enough. When your mind is focused totally on your opponents back you‚Äôll be shocked how often you end up there from chaotic situations seemingly without even trying. Don‚Äôt just program your BODY with skills, program your MIND with opportunity and then you‚Äôll become far more effective than with skills alone
"
"Sparring tired: It‚Äôs common to feel utterly exhausted some days in the middle of your sparring rounds. Sometimes you come in feeling fine and have a couple of very tough rounds and feel very fatigued. It‚Äôs natural to feel like stopping, maybe taking off a round a two and then starting again. You think this way because you are thinking in terms of WINNING OR LOSING rounds. If you‚Äôre exhausted it‚Äôs going to be very difficult to win and quite likely you‚Äôll lose to your next partner. So you take some rounds off and start again when you‚Äôve recovered a little.  This not good if you want to play at a competitive level. Doing this means you will never get the experience of performing through exhaustion. Change your mindset. Tell yourself - I‚Äôm exhausted - but I will keep going with a lowered set of expectations. Let‚Äôs imagine I‚Äôm ahead in a tough match and have to protect my lead and not get submitted. This will simulate the skill of operating under great fatigue and duress - a common thing in tough matches. You don‚Äôt want the finals of a tough competition to be the first time you do this - your own mind will start to fight against you - learn to tame it in the gym first and it will be much better than trying to learn it in the middle of a big match. Obviously if you are more recreational, older, perhaps not in competition shape, this will not apply as much, but you can still experiment with it to some degree. Remember, you don‚Äôt have to stop completely, just lower your goals and keep going - you will learn a lot about yourself in those rounds.
"
"The three most important elements of your game: In time you will rise to a given skill level. Whatever that level is it will be a reflection of the seriousness of your study and industry. The three most@important elements that determine your effectiveness on the mat will be your SKILL, your TACTICS and your AUTHENTICITY. The first two make sense and are universally acknowledged by all - but authenticity? What the hell is THAT? This is the degree to which your game is a reflection of WHO YOU ARE AS AN INDIVIDUAL. Nothing will wreck an athletes effectiveness faster than trying to play another athletes game. I don‚Äôt care what kind of game you ultimately express except that it is technically sound (skill), tactically sound (tactics) and YOURS (authentic). No matter how technically proficient and tactically a game is, my experience is that if it is not something that genuinely expresses your individuality as an athlete, it won‚Äôt be something you apply when the pressure is on. Just as you don‚Äôt feel comfortable wearing another persons clothes no matter how fancy and well tailored they might be, so too you won‚Äôt be comfortable playing another persons game. You can learn a LOT from others - but be SELECTIVE in what you take on board. Take what suits YOU and make modifications according to your needs and individual traits. When you can combine technical proficiency with sound tactics AND authenticity - you will have a very powerful game indeed
"
"Extension: Almost all of Jiu jitsu is performed in a compact stance. A big part of being defensively responsible in the sport is maintaining that compact stance. Accordingly, when you can get an opponent extended - it‚Äôs usually a good thing as it represents the opposite of what we normally see as good stance. Look to stretch your opponents knees away from his elbows whenever you can. He wants to be compact - you want him extended. Who consistently wins this simple preliminary battle often goes on to win the contest.
"
"Tape: If there is one ritual that all grapplers perform and understand it is wrapping up small scale injuries with athletic tape. Athletic tape plays a similar role in the life of grapplers as duct tape does for blue collar workers - it‚Äôs a quick fix for pretty much every problem! When it‚Äôs competition time and everyone‚Äôs body is sore every day and every session seems to create a new issue, jammed fingers, skin abrasions, twisted ankles and wrists - the pain is bothersome but not enough to stop you - that‚Äôs when the tape comes out üòúüòú If there is one thing I encourage you all to carry with you at all times it‚Äôs athletic tape. It has done more to keep grapplers on the mats than all the physical therapists, acupuncturists, mobility trainers and other rehabilitation experts combined üòúüòúüòÇüòÇ Make sure your study the basics of taping and wrapping your small joints up so you can stay active. Like anything there is a skill to it. Learn the different ways to wrap fingers,
Toes, wrists and ankles, cover a skin abrasion. It‚Äôs not difficult to learn and is a skill you‚Äôll be using often and as long as you‚Äôre doing jiu jitsu

"Not all grips are equal: Grip is the foundation of all grappling sports. If you can‚Äôt get an effective grip on someone, none of the moves are possible. Any time you can grip an opponent - he will be able to grip you too - it‚Äôs important therefore, to know how to impose a better upon him than he has upon you. Some grips confer a greater degree of control than others. Even from identical grips, there are subtle positional tricks that can confer advantages to you. Your goal is to attain a grip that offers you greater control over your opponent than he has over you. Whether you have attained this goal will be immediately apparent when you try to move and control each other.  If you are roughly same size and skill level but your grip makes it easier to move and control your opponent, then it‚Äôs likely you‚Äôve got a better grip than him. Don‚Äôt be satisfied with any grip - work hard to get a dominant grip whenever possible. Remember - in a world where everything begins with grip, your job overall gets significantly easier when you start every engagement with a better grip than the other guy
"
"Training in Thailand: We landed this morning in Thailand after a long day and night of flying and went to a local Muay Thai gym down the road to work out. It‚Äôs so fascinating to see the atmosphere in these local gyms. They are usually located on tiny backroads with traffic directly outside with open roofs. Space is tiny but talent is deep. The fighters literally live there, sleeping eating and training. In between their own workouts they train regular people but their primary focus is on winning their way to fight in the big local stadiums here in Bangkok. There is a deep culture of professional fighting here that begins in these tiny neighborhood gyms. It was a pleasure to workout next to them and pick up on that dedication and desire for technical proficiency that they exude.
"
"If you can get an opponents feet off the mat you own him: Everything we do in grappling presupposes contact with the mat. Imagine trying to grapple in zero gravity - you couldn‚Äôt perform moves effectively because you have nothing to base upon or push off from. When you leave the mat you have to wait until you you land before you can be effective again. It doesn‚Äôt matter how athletic you are - if you can‚Äôt push off the ground it‚Äôs very difficult to express that athleticism. Whenever you can - lift your opponent off the mat. The most energy efficient ways to do this is always with the legs. Work hard upon the skill of getting opponents up off the mat for brief periods of time and use that time to press your attacks - unless he‚Äôs truly a superb athlete capable of back flips or aerial cartwheels there‚Äôs not much he can do to stop you until he‚Äôs grounded again - and by then it‚Äôs usually too late.
"
"If you can preserve your BALANCE, then you can see and react well to every threat and at a moment‚Äôs notice launch your own attacks. If you can preserve your COMPOSURE then you can make good decisions even under stress. If you can preserve your BREATHING you can outlast an opponent who matches you in skill and strength. Keep your balance, your composure and your breathing under control whilst denying them to your opponent and you‚Äôll find victory far more often than not.
"
"Passing guard - head and hips: Whenever it‚Äôs time to pass your opponents guard, the two key elements are your opponents head and hips. In most cases you will use the hips as the first goal. You will need to close distance and gain angle in order to pass the line of your opponents hips. From that position you out your opponent into a defensive framework where he must focus upon recovering his guard rather than attacking you. Then the next goal is to get control of your opponents head and shoulders in order to finalize the pass. So for most passes, it‚Äôs a case of hips first, head last. A very important exception to this is half guard passing. This allows you to control the head PRIOR to passing. This is a huge advantage. It enables far greater control over an opponent and takes away the wild scrambles often associated with guard passing. If you are not the fastest or most agile player on the mat, passing from half guard may well be your best option. Moreover, half guard passing combines exceptionally well with other passing methods. When basic passing methods fail, they almost always present opportunities to drop into half guard and continue passing from there. Make sure you exploit the great power of passing from half guard as a centerpiece of your overall passing game - it works equally well gi or no gi and works for all body types and ages.

"Eyes: We spend all day training our bodies but the single most important element you must train is your EYES. Your eyes SEE opportunity long before your body ACTS on it. Moreover, if your eyes DON‚ÄôT see opportunity, your body won‚Äôt act at all. ACTIVE OBSERVATION - where you both see AND assess, is the most important thing you can develop - because until the eyes see possibility the body won‚Äôt create actuality. Build knowledge inside your mind and the eyes will learn to discern when watching. Staring vacantly won‚Äôt help you at all. Active observation stems from knowing what to look for. You can only train your body for some long every day until it is exhausted, but the mind can be pushed much longer with no ill effects. Once knowledge is imbedded, the eyes become begin everything you do
"
"Open guard is a four limbed beast - get your hands and feet working in unison: when working from open guard it is not your hands alone that will make you successful, nor will it be your feet working alone; rather, it will be the INTERACTION of your hands and feet working TOGETHER that will make you a devastating open guard player. Remember always that as your opponent passes your FEET and LEGS, you will stop and briefly hold him with your HANDS, but your HANDS are not strong enough to hold hime for LONG, so must recover your FEET AND LEGS back into position and start anew. Thus it is the constant cycling and interaction of FEET and hands, ARMS and LEGS that will make you the master of open guard that you must become in order to master the sport itself. Don‚Äôt emphasize upper Body and don‚Äôt emphasize lower body - emphasize WHOLE body and get feet and hands working TOGETHER and your open guard will one day become Unpassable and your attacks from there unstoppable

"Coming out from the shadows - Giancarlo Bodoni ADCC 2022: The greatest breakthrough performance in ADCC 2022 was undoubtedly Giancarlo Bodoni. I first met him around two years ago while filming instructional videos in Massachusetts where he worked at Bernardo Faria‚Äôs school as an instructor. He was a solid positional player in the gi and was looking to switch into no gi. The transition proved difficult as he was repeatedly leg locked in local competitions. When our team broke up in Puerto Rico he saw it as an opportunity to come and train full time in Austin. He uprooted his life and made the move. This commitment deeply impressed everyone, but even more impressive was his work ethic upon arrival. Every day he was in the gym working on every aspect of the game. As weeks became months his training intensity continued to rise. He started doing very well in local competitions. His submission finishes, a weak point of his prior game, started to massively improve. His leg lock game, his nemesis in the past, started to become a strong point. When he stepped on the mat at ADCC it would be a very different Giancarlo. In his four matches he finished three out of four of his opponents including the champion from the previous ADCC and was just seconds away from finishing the fourth when time expired. He did not have a single point scored on him. When he faced the athlete most people considered the foremost leg locker in the division, Giancarlo easily leg locked him. In exactly one year of work, Giancarlo completely reinvented himself. In the final he took on the formidable Lucas ‚ÄúHulk‚Äù Barbosa, a man who had defeated Giancarlo many times in the past. Beating someone who has repeatedly beaten you before is not easy - Giancarlo turned it all around and dominated the match and then submitted him. There is a powerful lesson in there for all of us. You are never a finished story. You are a never a final product. Improvement and progress is always possible. Obstacles that once seemed insurmountable can be overcome. People will always underestimate what you are now, but never let them make you underestimate what you can BECOME. Work hard and you won‚Äôt be in the shadows forever
"
"Details: This a game where one small adjustment to what you‚Äôre doing with a given move can mean the difference between success or failure, between winning and losing. It‚Äôs natural then, to obsess over details and try to learn as many as possible in the quest to improve your performance. Remember however, that the human mind has its limits and you won‚Äôt be able to remember much under the heat and stress of a competitive match. As such, you must learn to balance the need for detailed knowledge and the reality of our cognitive limitations. Don‚Äôt try to learn vast amounts of detail immediately. Rather, pick out two or three key details that have the most positive impact on your performance and focus on those - you can always add additional details later after you‚Äôve thoroughly imprinted the first set of details. Working in this manner is the best way to make quick and positive progress.
"
"Start small, with a plan of how to take it all: When you first come out to grapple with your opponent, the general pattern is to start with minor grips - usually starting at the hands or head. From there you work to increasing amounts of body contact and control. Because control is generally much easier on the ground than it is standing, the action typically transitions to the floor, where the idea is to get ever increasing amounts of body contact in ever increasing amounts of positional dominance. Make sure you realize this is a step by step process. Don‚Äôt try to take too much too early. Start with the small actions of gripping hands and head and build from there. Trying to grab too much too early makes you easy to counter attack. Work progressively towards your goals and don‚Äôt skip steps unless the opportunity is completely open (and even then be aware it could be a trap). You will probably have to repeat this process many times over the course of a tough match - get used to it - it is the way of all Jiu jitsu.
"
"Specific skill sets: I am notoriously bad at anything outside of jiu jitsu. Focus on one thing tends to make us deficient in others. It looks like some of my students are the same way üòÇüòÇ Here is Rory MacDonald trying to cook dinner after training. He is a great MMA fighter - chef? Hmmmm‚Ä¶not so much üòÇüòÇüòÇ The real mistake was letting a Canadian into the kitchen - that was my mistake üòÇüòÇüòÇ
"
"Climbing rope: The goal of grappling is control over your opponents body - and the two best areas of an opponents body to control are the head and hips - if you control either of those you are in command of his body. The problem is, no one will just let you get a hold of their head or hips, and so you must WORK your way there. The general pattern in the vast majority of grappling exchanges is to BEGIN AT THE EXTREMITIES OF THE BODY - THE HANDS OR FEET - AND WORK YOUR WAY PROGRESSIVELY UP THE ARMS OR LEGS TO GET TO YOUR GOAL OF THE HEAD OR HIPS. It‚Äôs like climbing a rope - you start at the bottom and work your way to the top from grip to grip until your get to your destination. In grappling your destination is the head or hips and you must climb your way grip to grip to get there. In all neutral positions whether standing or on the ground you will see this pattern of extremities to core emerging. Working in this way will keep you defensively sound until you control the head or hips - and then you can focus on your offense without hinderance.
"
"Falling in love with a technique: I‚Äôm sure you have a favorite pair of shoes, or favorite pair of jeans, definitely a favorite car that you preferred over all the other cars you ever drove. We have our favorites in every aspect of our lives. The more important that aspect is to us, the stronger that love is. Soldiers and hunters rely on a rifle to keep them alive and so they develop a deep connection with their favorite rifle. A musician relies on his instruments to make a living and so he develops a deep connection to his favorite violin, piano or guitar. In Jiu jitsu your technique is everything. The best athletes develop a very deep connection to their favorite techniques. Just like everything else in your live - your favorites will be the ones you always come back to and prefer to use when things get serious. There comes a point where you don‚Äôt just USE the technique - you IMMERSE yourself in it - and that‚Äôs when the path to mastery begins. Satoshi Ishii is a master of the classic Judo throw tai otoshi - the best I ever saw. He began study as a child, now in his mid thirties he still uses it every day and still learns new insights that enables him to use it in anyone, gi or no gi. He has gotten to a point where he can throw a man easily with one hand, and with so much control that he can determine which part of his opponents body hits the ground first. This is mastery. This is the path you must take to develop the depth required for excellence in Jiu jitsu and indeed, all aspects of life. Don‚Äôt just flirt with a technique - fall in love with it
"
"In a tough match you might only get one shot at victory‚Ä¶better to be damn good at a few moves than average at many. Nobody remembers the moves that ALMOST worked - they only remember the moves that DID work. You want enough diversity of moves to cover the whole body, but not so many that you never really master  any of them.
"
"Maximize your connection and minimize your opponents postural integrity: The biggest initial problem you will face when working from open guard is having no solid connection to your opponent. This will allow him to immediately get past your legs and pass before you can do anything effective. The second problem is that if his stance is well set, it will be very difficult to attack him successfully with either sweeps or submissions. So start by getting, whenever possible, BOTH FEET AND BOTH HANDS SET ON YOUR OPPONENT to form a solid connection that won‚Äôt allow an opponent to simply blow past your guard before you can do anything. Then make a pledge to yourself that prior to any major attack from underneath, you will BEGIN BY DISTURBING YOUR OPPONENTS STANCE/BALANCE. Do this two things consistently and you will soon find yourself a better offensive and defensive guard player.
"
"Work your way to a position rather than jump to a position: Superior position is always one of the major goals of the sport. As such many people don‚Äôt care too much how they get there so long as they get to the goal - but HOW you get there is important for your long term development. You want to WORK your way to a position - systematically working from grip to grip, hold to hold - your opponent under tight control throughout the movement. That‚Äôs not to say that you can‚Äôt have success jumping from one position to another - you definitely can - but it‚Äôs difficult to do this reliably and consistently as opponents will feel the space and lightness as you transition from one position to another and escape/counter in the transition. Long term it‚Äôs better to exert as much control in the transition as possible - that way you‚Äôll be successful for a long time even when opponents know what you‚Äôre trying to do
"
"Give yourself a hand: Nature gave you two hands to use in jiu jitsu, but training can give you a third - your head. Your hands can push and pull and opponent and create a base of support AND SO CAN YOUR HEAD - use it well and it‚Äôs like having a third hand to gain advantage over tough opponents. Any time you use your head as a substitute for a hand to push, pull or create base - you free up a hand to use to advantage against your opponent. Imagine fighting an opponent with three arms - it would be a nightmare - well, if you use your head creatively you can make yourself a nightmare to your opponents. Develop your neck strength and your head will become a powerful weapon of control and increase by a third your ability to push and pull opponents (the head doesn‚Äôt really pull so much as block movement but the practical effect is similar). Next time you feel like your running out of hands to control an opponent - use your head - you‚Äôll be amazed at how effective it is!
"
"Let the position do the work for you: You‚Äôve fought hard to gain a good position - it‚Äôs natural to want to take advantage of it by quickly launching into a submission - but if the submission should fail you will generally lose that position. Don‚Äôt just think position to submission. Think about position - pressure - submission. The real value of position is more than just an opportunity to submit an opponent. It‚Äôs real value is THE PRESSURE THAT ROBS AN OPPONENT OF THE WILL AND VITALITY REQUIRED TO ESCAPE THE SUBMISSION WHEN YOU CHOOSE TO APPLY IT. Spend some time building pressure and the submissions will be much easier than if you just go as quickly as you can to the next step.
"
"Life and jiu jitsu: Many of the lessons of Jiu jitsu mirror everyday life. Since you were old enough to listen you‚Äôve been told that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. This is true of Jiu jitsu also. The longer you leave the task of escape - the harder it gets. Early identification of oncoming problems will save you a vast amount of trouble on the mats. Escaping a bad position is much easier when the escape begins AS the opponent is getting into a dominant position rather than AFTER he gets there. Thus the key is the mental act of RECOGNITION of danger as much as the physical act of escaping after the fact. Learning the escapes is crucial to success, but so too is early identification and reaction, and if it‚Äôs done consistently can make make many escapes unnecessary
"
"Angle: We all figure out how early on in our development that is hard to attack someone directly from the front - you immediately run into their strongest lines of defense - the hands and head. Most success comes from circumventing those major lines of defense. In grappling this is done in two major ways - LEVEL and ANGLE. You can go UNDER and AROUND your opponents defenses much more easily that going THROUGH them. It‚Äôs not easy to get advantageous angle on good opponents. Usually there has to be some form of distraction or misdirection first - but once you‚Äôve got - it‚Äôs a great momentary advantage that you must use immediately as it won‚Äôt last forever. Understand that angular change doesn‚Äôt have to be dramatic to be effective. Here in a drill I have gotten to perpendicular - that‚Äôs great but difficult on a resisting opponent - you only need enough angle to slip outside head and hands - even a small angular advantage can yield good results. It‚Äôs particularly important when working to pass guard on top of attack from guard on bottom. Next time you‚Äôre working from either - don‚Äôt make your first move TOWARDS you opponent but rather AROUND your opponent and see if you can get better success with your attacks as a result
"
"Submission holds and failure: Submission requires total focus of bodily energy for a long enough time to make an opponent submit (or if he chooses not submit, to experience the consequences of his choice). That can be a very considerable energy expenditure in a short time. If it works - it was definitely worth it. In many cases however, you will see an athlete try as hard as he can, even for extended periods of time, and fail. This can have devastating effects. Physically it can be exhausting to apply maximum isometric tension for too long. It‚Äôs tough to recover from physical exhaustion at the best of time - in the midst of a highly competitive match is even harder. Psychologically it can severely dent your confidence to try submissions again later in the match and make you second guess yourself every time an opportunity arises. As such, it is extremely important that you develop an internal feeling of what a well applied submission feels like so that you know ahead of time whether it will be worth committing all your reserves into the attempt. With all your favorite submissions try to build this self knowledge so that next time you are in the position you will know with great confidence that you can give it your all for the time required and make it all worthwhile
"
"When behind an opponent - create a constant threat of strangulation - everything else you feeds off this: The back is the ultimate position in no gi grappling (and you could also argue that the same is true in gi Jiu jitsu and fighting). However, like any position, it has its limitations and getting the position does not guarantee victory against tough opponents. It is very important then, that you create a constant and unrelenting threat of strangulation from the back so that your opponent MUST address it or perish. If you ever see your opponent getting forgetful and raising his chin - go! Snake your wrist under the chin and finish him! If he is disciplined with his chin position, use his defensive chin and hands against him with arm traps and mandible strangles that make defense very difficult indeed.
"
"Moving fast - moving slow: Most of the time I prefer a smooth relaxed pace to Jiu jitsu over a lightning fast pace. This enables you to go longer, gives you time to think and solve problems as they arise and generally leads to fewer mistakes in execution. However, there are times it pays to put some gas on the throttle and GO! Any time you think the anticipated benefits of a successful short sprint are greater than the long slog of starting over again after going too slowly to capitalize on an opportunity - then you are licensed to step on the accelerator pedal and get going - just make sure it‚Äôs not for an extended period of time. Speed in jiu jitsu is both a blessing and a curse - be aware that it‚Äôs a curse much more often than it‚Äôs a blessing, so use it judiciously. Remember it‚Äôs not the speed that‚Äôs the problem, but rather maintaining the exertion required to get to that speed too long. Once you learn to step OFF the gas pedal at the appropriate time, you‚Äôll be able to step ON more often and with greater confidence

"Regulating tension: When you first began Jiu jitsu you probably had the same problem everyone else does - you got very tense and tight and as a result quickly exhausted yourself. As you improved, you learned to relax and then you could spar fore much longer periods without fatigue being such an issue. Then a new problem emerged. In this relaxed state, sometimes the submissions you attempted were not tight enough and opponents escaped. Learning to regulate the muscular tension in your body during sparring is a huge part of your development from beginner to expert. In general the body moves fastest and longest in a state of athletic relaxation, so this is the state you want to be in for most of the match when MOVEMENT into winning positions is your primary focus. The body best exhibits control over another body in a state of ISOMETRIC TENSION. This will you need to find a balance between the athletic relaxation that allows you to move fluidly and efficiently into good positions and the isometric tension that enables you to lock on tight to a submission hold,  stay locked on despite the strongest resistance and exhibit sufficient strength to force a submission. You can see the kind of tension required for a breaking submission against a tough opponent as Garry Tonon shows his isometric strength with a punishing heel hook on his way to another EBI title.

"Plot your next move: There are times in Jiu jitsu where you have to move quickly and keep moving - there simply isn‚Äôt time to think and you have to trust in the habits you gained through training in the gym to prevail. Fortunately there are just as many times where you DO have time to stop, think and plot your next move among competing options. Unfortunately we all have a tendency to ignore the different nature of these two situations and we often just unthinkingly charge ahead to the next move when we actually had plenty of time to think and plot. MAKE SURE YOU USE TIME CONSTRUCTIVELY IF TIME IS AVAILABLE - it often means the difference between moving for the sake of moving versus moving with a purpose. There are many situations in Jiu jitsu where you exert sufficient control where you can take some time to figure out the next move. Here, Gordon Ryan uses the control afforded by a tight back head and arm (seatbelt) grip to plot how he will get hooks in and score

"Heading back: Early morning start back to Austin after EBI 20 Open Weight in El Paso Tx. It was great seeing the return of the old EBI grappling format last night. Unfortunately Giancarlo Bodoni badly tore a rib in the opening minute of his first match. He went on to win in over time but could not continue into the next round as even breathing was very difficult. Any time breathing is painful with rib injuries it‚Äôs prudent to avoid further damage - especially in an open weight event where all your opponents are much larger than you. Luke Griffith had a fine win in his first match via mounted smother. In his second match he had a great tussle with Nicky Rod and attacked well with a heel hook, Nicky Rod came back with excellent positional control passing into mount. They went to over time and Nicky Rod won with a very well applied transition to arm lock from back control. Nicky Rod went on to win the event in fine fashion - showing that he is much more than a wrestler with fine array of submissions. Now it‚Äôs back to Austin for a full day of teaching! Hope you all enjoyed the show!

"If you can make an opponent stumble - whichever move you choose to perform next will be easy: There are many truly valuable combat skills, but one which may not seem very useful on the surface is in fact, arguably among the most useful of them all, since it makes possible so many of the other more well known and glamorous skills - this is the ability to MAKE YOUR OPPONENT STUMBLE AT WILL. If you can do this it will be MUCH easier to perform the subsequent moves that you use to score or finish with. You must develop the ability to the greatest degree possible. It is particularly important when you are grappling in standing position and in situations where you are seated in open guard and your opponent is standing in front of you (though it is important in other common scenarios also). You must be able to make your opponent stumble both forward and backwards, as resistance to one direction will set up attacks in the other. You will need to develop good dexterity in your feet as you will be using your feet and legs like hands and arms to reach out and grab and push and pull. If you can make a man stumble, you make him well nigh defenseless for a quarter of a second - and in combat sports, quarter of a second can be an awfully long time. So work hard on this skill - for it will make many of your other skills much easier to apply
"
"Every Jiu jitsu athlete try‚Äôs to create problems for their opponent. That‚Äôs good. If you can CREATE problems faster and more imaginatively than your opponent can SOLVE them you will eventually win. But better yet is to go beyond creating PROBLEMS and create DILEMMAS. These have no solution - only a choice between two bad outcomes. When you can put opponents into dilemmas your opponent will avoid one option and will win on the other horn of the dilemma. Here Gordon Ryan demonstrates it perfectly with a front triangle combined with armbar. If his opponent stacks forward to avoid the armbar he will be strangled by the triangle. If he postures up and away from the strangle he will expose his arm to the arm bar. Whichever choice makes he will be submitted. That is the highest kind of Jiu jitsu.
"
"Reflections: When Gordon Ryan was matched against Ralek Gracie several years ago it was a rather surreal experience. The match was in the legendary Torrence Gracie academy where Brazilian jiu jitsu gained its first foothold in the United States. When I began jiu jitsu in the mid 1990‚Äôs I remember being in awe of grainy VHS images of challenge matches in that academy and being so impressed by the way they used jiu jitsu to dispel many of the prevailing beliefs about fighting from that era and usher in a new way of looking at martial arts that we still benefit from now. We were there in effect for a challenge match in a different era so it was a strange feeling. Rorion Gracie was a gracious host and he showed around a beautiful jiu jitsu museum he has built inside the academy featuring the history of the Gracie family. I love the history of the old Japanese and Brazilian masters who gave birth to this art. Many of them were fascinating characters. The sport has changed so much in some ways but it‚Äôs core principles and methods remain largely unchanged. I always wonder what the old masters would think if they saw the modern changes in jiu jitsu - would they be impressed or horrified? I guessing they‚Äôd be both. No matter what their feelings about us - I will always be grateful for them

"Ideals of Jiu jitsu: At its core jiu jitsu is concerned with the use of mechanics and tactics to overcome greater size, strength and aggression. As such, it adheres to certain foundational principles that guide our behavior on the mats. One of the more important principles is this - whenever faced with opponents of greater size and strength, try to make the match a fight between your legs versus their upper body. The human body has an obvious discrepancy between the strength and endurance of the lower body and upper body. It doesn‚Äôt matter how much bigger and stronger an opponent is than you - it‚Äôs very unlikely his arms are stronger than your legs. As such, always try to fight your opponents upper body with your legs to the greatest degree possible. One of the clearest expressions of this foundational principle is the triangle hold. It uses both your legs to strangle an opponent and control his head and one arm. It can be done from virtually anywhere and has many variations. Here, middleweight Giancarlo Bodoni uses it in the ADCC World Championship to successfully strangle a heavyweight in the open weight division. Harness the inherently greater strength of your legs to fight the inherently weaker strength of your opponents upper body and victory will often find you

"Double World Champion!! Outstanding teenage phenom Helena Crevar @helenajiujitsugirl won double gold at the IBJJF World Championships in California yesterday. She won both her weight division and absolute division in the teenage blue belt category. She won all matches via submission with a heavy emphasis of triangles and arm bars in an excellent display of her attacking style. When Nicholas Meregali was preparing for his WNO gi match we began morning gi classes balanced with afternoon no gi. After the match Helena continued her gi training with just a single training partner every day as the rest of the class reverted back to no gi training for upcoming matches. She showed excellent focus and discipline throughout that preparation and successfully applied many of the moves and tactics she worked in her preparation. Well done Helena!!

"Knowing what success feels like and what failure feels like - minimum requirements for submission holds: Submission holds are an all or nothing affair. Typically They either work completely and end the match or don‚Äôt work at all and the action continues (occasionally there are cases where they work but the opponent just keeps fighting on  with a broken limb and in these cases they have worked to some degree insofar as the rest of the match will be easier fighting against a partially crippled opponent). They take up a considerable amount of energy when applied full force against a tough opponent. You definitely don‚Äôt want to hang on grimly to a failed submission hold that has little or no chance of working and needlessly expend vast sums of precious energy fruitlessly. On the other hand, you don‚Äôt want to quit early at the first sign of resistance and lose a great chance to win. How do you distinguish scenarios where we should cut our losses and release to go on to something else versus holding on to get the win? The key is to recognize the minimum essential features to the success of the move - for example every heel hook requires that at a minimum your opponents knee should be trapped within your knee line. Every juji gatame requires at the minimum that your hips should be locked to an opponents shoulder/armpit. Every Kimura has the minimum requirement that your figure four lock should be above your opponents elbow. That minimum requirement(s) is your basic guide. If you satisfy it - it is probably a good idea to persist with the lock. If you can‚Äôt satisfy it - it‚Äôs probably a good idea to abandon it and move on to another attack. Know your minimum requirements and you will know ahead of time whether success or failure with the hold in imminent and save yourself a lot frustration

"INITIALLY TRAIN AT A PACE WHERE YOU CAN THINK BEFORE YOU ACT. ONE DAY YOU WILL REACH A THRESHOLD WHERE AS THE PACE QUICKENS YOU FIND YOURSELF ABLE TO ACT EFFECTIVELY BEFORE YOU EVEN THINK - AND THEN THE VICTORIES COME FAR MORE OFTEN THAN THE DEFEATS
"
"The power of pins: Probably the quickest method of fatiguing an opponent is to make them carry your weight inefficiently. The most inefficient way to carry bodyweight is with your head and shoulders. Any position that forces an opponent to bear your weight on his head and shoulders will exhaust him over time. Pins are a fine example of this. Get your chest over his shoulders and face and he will struggle under your weight. That struggle is exhausting. Pinning like this is a precursor to submission. Tired opponents always quit more easily than fresh opponents. Don‚Äôt pin for points - PIN FOR PRESSURE - and you‚Äôll have a game that opponents fear
"
"Demarcation point - the elbow: It sounds so obvious as to be foolish, but It‚Äôs important to know where you are in grappling, because knowledge of where you are determines how you ought to act. In most cases it‚Äôs pretty obvious where you are - inside a closed guard, side control, knee on belly, north south etc etc Most white belts can tell you immediately where they are at any given point in a match. Things can get more tricky in some situations however. The most commonly occurring situation is where you are still ostensibly in front of your opponent BUT YOU HAVE GOTTEN BEHIND HIS ELBOW. If you look at this picture of Gordon Ryan from last years ADCC world championships you will probably think that he is in the mounted position - and by standard criteria you would be correct. However, he has gotten behind his opponents elbow. Even though they are still chest to chest, once you‚Äôve beaten your opponents elbow you are 90% of the way to the back - at this point you should already be switching mentally to the idea that you are BEHIND your opponent and adjusting your targets accordingly. Remember that the elbow is the single most important demarcation point in upper body back attacks - once you‚Äôve passed that point it‚Äôs time to start thinking in terms of a new position and change your focus.

"Squad gets a wake up call on how they have been living a lie of butt scooting tom foolery and leg locking cowardice courtesy of Master Ken: Master Ken showed up in Puerto Rico to a squad training session and gave some encouraging words of advice and mentorship as he described us as ‚Äúa bunch of weirdos with a foot fetish and a proclivity to hump each other‚Äôs legs,‚Äù and advised us to practice a real martial art instead. We will definitely start incorporating the throat punches and cock destructions he demonstrated in future training sessions and possibly the next Who‚Äôs Number One competition - looking forward to tomorrow‚Äôs training session!
"
"Against good opponents the first move rarely scores - you will be judged primarily by the quality of your second, third or fourth attack that actually gets the breakthrough. Having said that, don‚Äôt get lazy with those initial attacks. If they are not performed with real commitment, or at the very least the appearance of real commitment, they won‚Äôt provoke the responses that make the second, third or fourth attack succeed. So even if you expect them to fail and are using then only as a set up to a later attack - go in with commitment. Only then will the opponent respond in ways that make the later real attack succeed
"
"Gravity: There is no doubt that the use of gravity has big effects on the outcome of matches. Most people think gravity helps the top athlete - after all, if I‚Äôm on top gravity naturally creates a sense of weight and pressure that can immobilize and exhaust an opponent. It is however, crucial that you understand that gravity can work in the bottom athletes favor as well. Instead of weight pressure and weight, the bottom athlete focuses on off balancing the opponent. Once balance has been broken, gravity will create an immediate stumbling and falling effect that makes subsequent attacks easy. Gravity itself doesn‚Äôt change - it helps both the top and the bottom athlete equally - just in different ways. Make sure you know and understand them both so that gravity is not your friend when you‚Äôre on top but your enemy when you‚Äôre on bottom, but rather, your trusted friend regardless of where you are

"Victory in Las Vegas! Nicholas Meregali performed one of the most impressive feats I have seen in Grappling tonight in Las Vegas. Two weeks ago he defeated the great double ADCC champion Kaynan Duarte - the man most people believe is the greatest no gi grappler on the plant outside of Gordon Ryan. Tonight he defeated the man most people believe is the best active gi grappler on the planet Victor Hugo. To defeat two such great champions in two weeks in two very different grappling styles is truly impressive. Both Mr Meregali and Mr Hugo showed they were a level above the rest of the field by quickly submitting both their first two world class opponents. The final was a tense tactical affair with Mr Meregali winning via sweep and subsequent top control - very impressive indeed especially given that he was considerably outweighed by his rival. What an amazing performance by this great athlete. In an age of specialists he is showing it‚Äôs still possible to beat the best back to back gi and no gi!
"
"Space: Whenever you play bottom position in Jiu jitsu a fundamental requirement for you to be effective is enough space between you and your opponent for you to be able to move freely into your techniques. You seek a middle ground. Too much space and you won‚Äôt be close enough to actually apply techniques. Too little space and you won‚Äôt have adequate room in which to move to get into your techniques. A good rule of thumb is that if you have space to bring one knee and elbow close together under an opponent while still maintaining contact - you have enough space to move and enough proximity to be effective. This state of affairs won‚Äôt last long - a good top opponent will always seek to rob you of space - so once once you‚Äôve created space it‚Äôs time to get to work!
"
"Defense into offense: The skills of Jiu jitsu are often split into defensive and offensive skills, but in truth the higher method consists of the close merger of the two; so that all your offensive moves have built in defensive responsibility and all your defense has built in counter offense. When you can go seamlessly from one to the other you will be a very difficult opponent for anyone. Here, Giancarlo Bodoni shows the spirit of defense straight into counter offense en route to ADCC gold

"The not-so-gentle art: Jiu jitsu, like all combat sports, aspires towards maximum efficiency in physical output. It strives to use the least amount of energy to get the job done. This is often misconstrued to mean that everything should appear effortless and flowing in execution. It is certainly true that for the majority of any given match your body ought to be fairly relaxed and loose to allow efficient movement, but there are definitely times when you want to exert near maximal muscular contraction and effort for short bursts. THIS is part of the pathway to true efficiency. If you are too relaxed when applying a submission hold and the opponent escapes - then you have to start all over again - necessitating the repeated expenditure of a large amount of energy and potential risk of losing. There is nothing efficient about that. True efficiency is being relaxed when appropriate (usually the majority of the match) but also tight when appropriate (usually for short bursts when scoring or finishing). This way you don‚Äôt waste energy getting to a scoring or finishing situation and fail due to lack of tight connection/power and then have to repeat yourself all over again. One quick burst of near maximal energy output that ends a match is not as fatiguing as twenty minutes of relaxed sparring that requires you to keep going and going due to repeatedly failing to score or finish because you were too loose at the critical moment. So yes, stay relaxed most of the time - but when it‚Äôs time to go - GO
"
"Be ready with both mind and body: When you come out to engage with an opponent there are a thousand possibilities for both of you. You have two modes of defense. The first is mental - this is AWARENESS. If you are mentally aware of dangers BEFORE their onset, defense is always easier. The second is physical - this is your stance. A good stance covers the most likely attack options an opponent has whilst facilitating your own attacks. Weaknesses in stance always make your opponents job easier and your job more difficult. When you go out there - be mentally aware of dangers and physically set in a strong stance that enables you to confront and overcome those dangers and you‚Äôll always a tough opponent for anyone.
"
"Attack the obstacle - then the submission: Every move has its counters - no exceptions. When you see an opponent employing a counter to your move - attack the obstacles he has placed in your path rather than just grind away and hope perseverance will make your move work. If you‚Äôre trying to strangle an opponent from the back and he is fighting your strangle arm with his hands - attack his hands. Pin them down with your hands and legs so that these obstacles are now removed - allowing your strangle to now become effective again. In the midst of the action you must be able to identify the method and manner of your opponents counters and then run interference on those counters. That‚Äôs why we put such a high priority on a calm and relaxed demeanor as you work into your submissions - only then can you identify and counter the problems in front of you. Here, Gordon Ryan controls his opponents two defensive hands and is preparing to pin one down with his leg to completely remove them as a means of defense - only then will the strangle come in unopposed
"
"Priorities: Any time you‚Äôre in a bad situation it is imperative that you prioritize the most most serious threats first and address them before the secondary threats. Any time you are in a bad spot in Jiu jitsu you will face multiple threats. Some will be more serious than others - make sure those are the first ones you address. Here, Gordon Ryan is in a critical situation. Because he is addressing the primary threat first (the strangle) he can remain calm and start making decisions as to how to deal with the secondary threat (the rear mount position). Bad position is already bad enough without making it even worse by mistakenly trying to deal with secondary threats before primary threats.
"
"If you are unstable - anyone on top of you will also be unstable: When you pin someone from top position your stability is heavily influenced by the stability of the person you are on top of. If he is stable, then you‚Äôll be stable on top of him. Once you understand this, you‚Äôll see that one of you goals when being pinned is to make yourself unstable. This is the central insight in many forms of escape from mount. If you can make your body unstable through stance and motion - kipping, bridging, shrimping - your opponent on top will also become unstable and then you can work to complete the escape. WHEN HIS STABILITY IS DEPENDENT ON YOURS - MAKE YOURSELF UNSTABLE. Then the actual escapes will be much easier to complete
"
"Developing a favorite move: Jiu jitsu is not just a science of levers and fulcrums and centers of gravity; it is a deeply personal art of self expression. In a world of millions of competing choices, you get to choose which moves will become yours and express yourself through them. It is crucial that you learn Jiu jitsu this way. The Japanese in their wisdom recognize the importance of this and term favorite moves ‚ÄúTOKUI-WAZA.‚Äù You must develop YOUR tokui-waza. From these favorite moves will come most of your successes. Whenever you‚Äôre in trouble they will be your shield. Whenever you struggle to get the breakthrough, they will be your hammer. Here, Georges St Pierre, an athlete whose most famous tokui-waza in MMA was his double leg takedown, works his favorite grappling move - Kimura from bottom half guard. As opponents learn that you have a favorite move, they will learn to counter it - forcing you to evolve and improve your knowledge and performance of the move and to learn new, complimentary moves to supplement it - and thus your overall skill level increases like branches growing from the central trunk of a tree. This is one of the best ways to grow quickly in Jiu jitsu - and it all starts with developing some favorites - what will be yours?
"
"Priorities: It‚Äôs a common thing to see a young student attacking enthusiastically from the back and focus too much on the submission rather than positional maintenance. If the attack fails they also lose the position as well as the submission. Remember, as long has you hold the position, you can fail repeatedly and keep trying and again and again until you get the breakthrough. As such, prioritize the position over any given submission attempt. SUBMISSION FAILURE IS ACCEPTABLE IF YOU MAINTAIN POSITIONAL INTEGRITY, BUT IF YOU LOSE POSITION YOU LOSE  EVERYTHING. When you go for your submissions from the back, monitor your positional robustness at all times. If you ever feel that being compromised - STOP - and recover positional integrity. As long as you do this you can always go back to try again with your submissions

Dan defeated Brazilian heavyweight Antonio Assef via uchi mata takedown into heel hook in less than a minute to take a decisive win. Here he is hanging out with my teacher Renzo Gracie who was a guest at the show! Congratulations Dan!
"
"Closing distance: Most jiu jitsu students have a tendency to think the action starts when you get a grip on your opponent and doesn‚Äôt get serious until you have close connection. It is very important that you understand that the action begins BEFORE you make contact in the action of CLOSING DISTANCE that makes contact possible. Even as you approach your opponent you must change your demeanor to one of preparation for action. You must enter your stance, move with appropriate footwork, and seek to initiate contact in ways that confer advantage to you rather than the opponent. The action begins as you approach each other, not after you‚Äôve gripped each other. Stance , motion and positioning for advantageous contact and connection are the key themes - and the battle starts earlier than many believe, whether it be in standing position or on the ground - like all things in life, so too in jiu jitsu - start your preparation earlier and you‚Äôll have less work to do later!
"
"Knots: I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve all had the frustration of trying to untie a tightly tangled knot. At times there is a strong natural urge to just yank harder on the string/rope  and use brute force to untangle it. This rarely works and usually just makes  things worse. So too in Jiu jitsu, when trying to untangle the knots of your opponents limbs when attempting arm locks and leg locks. Getting frustrated and tanking and pulling with brute force won‚Äôt untie human knots any better than rope knots. Just as you with a knot of rope - take a step back, relax, and look at the configuration of your opponents limbs and then make reasoned solutions to the puzzle in front of you - as with all knots - A GENTLE PULL IN THE RIGHT DIRECTIONS WILL HAVE MUCH GREATER BENEFITS THAN HARD YANKING AND STRUGGLING IN THE WRONG DIRECTIONS. Look at the calm demeanor of Nicky Ryan as he goes about untying his opponents defensive arms while pursuing a juji gatame arm bar - as a result, when he finally does commit to a hard pull - it will separate the arms and bring victory rather than frustration
"
"It‚Äôs a lot easier to take someone down when you‚Äôre behind them than when you‚Äôre in front of them: It‚Äôs never easy to take a skilled grappler down when you‚Äôre directly in front of them. Worse still, it can be downright risky when they have strong positional and submission counters to your takedown attempts. In contrast, takedowns from the standing rear body lock are easier and safer. You don‚Äôt have to get past your opponents head, hands and hips - the major defensive lines when operating from frontal positions. You don‚Äôt have to worry so much about guillotines and front headlock strangles - there is some threat from rolling leg lock entries and kimura but substantially less than the guillotine/front headlock danger from in front. Best of all - your feet are very close to your opponents feet - which opens up the possibility of ashi waza foot sweeps. These are among the safest and most energy efficient takedowns in the game and are a big part of my coaching program. There are many paths to the back in standing position - some are deliberate and planned moves, some are spontaneous reactions to a perceived opportunity that arose as you grappled - both approaches can put you in a position to make the task of takedowns much easier
"
"Don‚Äôt give it away for free (unless you‚Äôre setting a trap): The grip fighting that precedes engagement is a subtle art. Too often athletes give free access to good grips to their opponents. If he gets a good grip on you from which to begin the process of control to attack then it should be because he EARNED it - not because you gave it to him. When he goes to control your wrist, pull your wrist away or strip his grip and take your own - don‚Äôt just leave wrists out there to be taken and controlled. The only exception to this is when you are setting traps for an opponent and you are using a bait to draw him in. If grip is the first step to control and control is what leads to match winning submission - then make sure he never gets easy grips that lead you into a downward spiral. Be ready deny, block and strip grips because the moment they are established a good opponent will be looking to take them further
"
"The mind must perceive opportunity before the body can act upon it - thus training your perception is every bit as important as training your physical movements. All the physical skill in the world is worthless without a mind that sees opportunity and directs the body towards it
"
"Make the mount and rear mount your pinning goals: The central focus of jiu jitsu is to get into upper body dominant pins that create an asymmetry between your ability to attack the opponent - which is very high - and his ability to attack you - which is very low. Foremost among the pins are mount and rear mount. They are the highest scoring positions in Jiu jitsu - scoring double what any takedown or guard sweep scores, more than guard passes or any other pin. No other positions put so much physical and tactical pressure on your opponents. You can directly attack their ability to breath in these positions. It‚Äôs often tempting when you start out jiu jitsu to be happy just with passing into side control and staying safe there, after all, side control is a very stable position and most beginners find it easier to get to and maintain than mount or rear mount. This will hold back your long term progress. Go the extra distance and get mounted or rear mounted. Don‚Äôt worry if your initial attempts result in you losing position a few times. In time you will learn to ride mount positions against even very spirited resistance and you‚Äôll have a a pin that creates devastating pressure, inhibits breathing which creates defensive over reaction that will greatly boost your submissions game

"The lights of LA: Just arrived in LA for the big WNO grappling event this weekend with Giancarlo Bodoni and Gordon Ryan. I‚Äôve always loved my times in LA - it‚Äôs great to be back and see the lights.
"
"Two for the price of one: GOOD jiu jitsu players create PROBLEMS for their opponents; but GREAT jiu jitsu players create DILEMMAS for their opponents. Whenever you create situations where you can play two threats simultaneously against an opponent such that the more the opponent tries to avoid one, the more he exposes himself to the other, you have created a winning situation for yourself. One of the very best examples of this comes from the TRIANGLE and this is definitely a great starting point for you to build the concept into your thinking about jiu jitsu. I‚Äôm almost every variation of the triangle you have both a threat of STRANGLE and JOINT LOCK. As you attack the strangle and your opponent defends, you can immediately switch to arm bar ( juji gatame), kimura, straight arm bar (ude gatame) and wrist locks, even an American lock in some cases. The relationship goes both ways; as you attack these joint locks you can overcome resistance by switching back to the strangle. Here, Gordon Ryan switches the emphasis of his triangle attack from strangle to juji gatame arm bar to overcome the initial line of resistance and create a game ending dilemma. This type of thinking must become part of your jiu jitsu consciousness - and the triangle is an excellent place for you to start
"
"If you could have a superpower‚Ä¶Imagine God came to you one night and declared that he wants to give you an entry level super power - not a crazy super power like Thanos or Superman that makes you into a God - but a genuine human level superpower. He gives you a choice. You either choose the ability to make yourself massively stronger than everyone else on the planet, or you can make everyone else on the planet massively weaker than yourself (so you aren‚Äôt any stronger, but you can make anyone in front of much much weaker). Which would you choose?  There is definitely a sense in which the first choice is smarter, since if you become much stronger you can apply that new strength to anything - you could use it to fight humans or lift cars or perform tasks that no one else can. The second choice only applies to humans and so would only have value when trying to overcome someone in a match. So in a fantasy world the first option makes more sense. But what about the real world of Jiu jitsu? Is it smarter for us to focus on greater ourselves stronger? Or making our opponents weaker? Well, I strongly urge you to work on both. As athletes we all have a responsibility to try to improve every aspect of our physicality - it‚Äôs an important part of performance in Jiu jitsu. However, in the real world there are definite limits on what can be done to improve your strength, speed and stamina. Once you get to a certain level you start to experience diminishing returns on the time invested in training. There is no great difference in sparring against someone who bench presses 400 pounds versus someone who presses 550 pounds in Jiu jitsu. They both feel strong - yet the amount of time and effort it takes to get from 400 to 550 pounds on the bench is very considerable. When it comes to making people weaker however, there are virtually no limits. Small improvements in position, angle, biomechanics,
can severely degrade an opponents strength and overall athleticism and you can keep making improvements forever. We all have a responsibility to make ourselves as strong as we can - BUT JIU JITSU IS MUCH MORE ABOUT MAKING THE OTHER FELLOW WEAKER THAN IT IS ABOUT MAKING OURSELVES STRONGER

"Getting ready: Tomorrow night in Austin Texas @flograppling will host the finale to their WHOSE NEXT grappling reality show which featured many outstanding rising talents and colorful characters. Headlining the event is a fascinating rematch between the very talented Pedro Merinho and Gordon Ryan. Last time they met at ADCC 2019 Mr Ryan quickly won via heel hook, but since then Mr Merinho has made a thorough study of the leg lock game and has beaten great leg lockers since then. Pedro has a very dangerous guillotine and excellent takedowns. In the last twelve months he has been winning everything he entered and beaten legends like Cyborg, Craig Jones and Vagner Rocha - this will be a very tough match! Nicholas Meregali will have his second ever no gi match against the very talented Strangle specialist Breylor Grout. Mr Meregali fearlessly stepped in as a replacement for Luke Griffith who had a training injury just days before the event. Giancarlo Bodoni will take on the juggernaut of the West Coast ADCC trials Jay Rodriguez in what should be a spectacular bout of two great developing grapplers. Dan Manasoiu will take on the man who fought and won a legendary three hour match during the reality show - clearly this Mr Overvig is a mentally tough opponent who can overcome great adversity to get the win. Mr Manasoiu will need all of his rapidly expanding technique to prevail against such a physically and mentally strong opponent. Mike Rakeshan will rematch his nemesis Sewer Rat (that is not a typo) after their epic match during the show. Both men have very unorthodox games and are not afraid to take big risks on the mat! The finale also features the two finalists from the show - B Team standout Izaak Mitchell vs 10th Planet champion Kyle Chambers. This should be a great evening of grappling! Get ready for a night of grappling action!!

"Looking back at yourself: As much as I encourage students to focus on their future goals and skill development, an important part of that future focus is to periodically look back upon yourself to check for signs of progress. It can be quite a shocking experience to look back at old video of yourself in training. You can learn a lot by looking at old footage and COACHING YOUR OLD SELF. You will of course see a thousand mistakes - you know so much more now than you did then. This simple exercise will reinforce many lessons you learned and crystallize them in a memorable way to help you recall and emphasize them for future training and development. Here, a teenage Gordon Ryan goes through early leg lock training - rough and untutored compared with his current self - but the basic outlines are there. You can see potential and directions for the future. Learn to see the same potential in yourself - take a look back sometimes to help you steer the way forward

"What is Jiu jitsu really about? More than anything else Jiu Jitsu is about compensating for inequalities in physical attributes between different people. The day we are conceived we are thrown into the genetic lottery which will determine our size, speed and many other physical attributes. The day we are born we are thrown into the hands of fate which will determine much of our development. By the time we are old enough to think we start to note that many or perhaps even most of the people around us have considerable physical advantages over us. So often everyone else seems faster, stronger, more flexible, heavier, taller, longer reach - the list goes on. It can reach into mental attributes as well. Our peers seem more confident, smarter, more aggressive etc etc. We are left looking at ourselves in the mirror as ungifted in comparison. JIU JITSU IS OUR ATTEMPT TO USE MECHANICS, TECHNIQUE AND TACTICS TO COMPENSATE FOR OUR PHYSICAL AND EVEN MENTAL SHORTCOMINGS. Leverage can make a weak person strong. Good position can make a strong person feel weak. Anticipation can make a slow person fast. Precise pinning can make a light person heavy. Good off balancing can make a heavy person light. Strangleholds can pacify even the most aggressive people. Success over time in training can make a coward brave and the timid confident. There are many things in life in which you have little choice. Jiu jitsu is a means by which you can make a stand and redefine who you are through study and training. In this sense the choice to study Jiu jitsu is your chance to overcome all those areas of your life in which you felt you had no choice and in which it seemed you were disadvantaged. I‚Äôve seen many things in the course of my life but perhaps one of the most remarkable has been the degree to which the study of Jiu jitsu grips so many people from so many backgrounds with a passion and enthusiasm for participation and improvement that I don‚Äôt see in most sports, where most involvement is simply as a spectator or as a game that is fun to play rather than as a way to change who they are.

"Thank you! Thanks so much to all the folks who came to support Marcelo Garcia last night at Xtreme Couture in Las Vegas prior to IBJJF World Masters. Over eighty people attended and will give Mr Garcia great boost as he recovers from cancer surgery over the next six months. Thank you all so much. It was a pleasure working with @gordonlovesjiujitsu @nicholasmeregali and @helenajiujitsugirl and watching them do such an outstanding job teaching. It was an honor to be part of such a great cause and for such a great man. Tomorrow Nicholas and Helena compete in what has become one of the biggest events of the year - there are also some really great grappling super matches in addition to the main event Grand Prix - keep your eyes on this one!

"Victory in Singapore!! Garry Tonon took a unanimous decision victory over a very game and dangerous title contender Koyomi Matsushima in Singapore. It has been more than a year since Mr Tonon fought due to circumstances and COVID-19. He was able to his extensive half guard bottom training done in this camp to advantage and take his opponents back to threaten strangles and take first round. Round 2 he showed his growing skill in integrating striking with takedowns to take the wrestler down and hold him down to again take the back. In the third round he landed a nice rear hand followed by knee to rock his opponent to take the bout very comfortably and get his MMA path back on track after the long layoff. Hope you all enjoyed the show!! Now Mr Tonon will join us in Puerto Rico and get back into training for the next challenge!! üòúüòú

"I just completed my first 10,000 miles of driving - a feat you all probably did by the age of fifteen üòÇüòÇ I never drove before other than a very brief stint in California in the 1980‚Äôs since I lived most of my adult life in New York City where a car is a major liability for most people. In the short time I‚Äôve been driving I‚Äôve been hit twice and had a few major near misses üòÇüòÇ I have definitely developed a healthy respect for what you have all been dealing with your whole lives - driving is an expensive and time consuming business where it seems the only certainties are depreciation and accidents and ever increasing costs! üòÇüòÇ I think perhaps I was wiser than I thought to avoid it all these years!

"End of an era: It is with great sadness that I have to announce the break up of the squad as a unified training and competition team. A combination of factors revolving around disagreements in physical location of a future school, personality conflicts, conflicting values and an inevitable tension between the team brand and the growing individual brands of members were the main factors. I am immensely proud of the tremendous effect the squad had upon the development and direction of our beloved sport over the years. I am extremely confident that all the various team members have risen in competitive ability,  teaching skill and independent creativity that they will be highly successful wherever they choose to go - whatever happens their legacy is assured and their future very bright indeed. As for the future, it is still uncertain. Most of us still get along very well. I expect some will still train together and we will work together in future projects in accordance with our team philosophy, but no longer as a single unified room. I believe the split will have the positive effect of creating a larger footprint for the team as they spread out and develop a wider influence. I always believed that the technical development of the team was best created by a tight, unified room, but at the end of the day human happiness outweighs medals and martial skill and it has become clear that some individual members would be happier in different locations. I would like to thank all the members of the squad for the tremendous effort and myriad sacrifices they made to build a team and legacy that will be remembered, in particular, Garry Tonon, Gordon Ryan, Craig Jones, Eddie Cummings, Nicky Ryan and Nick Rodriguez. I would also like to thank the many students who formed the room in which the squad developed and honed their skills; and thank you so much to all our faithful followers for your interest and support over the years - I hope and trust we can keep the project of refining our art going despite the changes - Thank you

"The internationalization of grappling: Twenty five years ago grappling was a sport completely dominated by one country - Brazil. As time passed The United States became a powerhouse with many outstanding athletes and it started to become a two country sport. Recently however, Australia, Canada, England, Poland and other nations have become very strong and putting out world beaters. Today at the @aiga.global grappling event in Kazakstan the new expansion of talent and involvement was dramatically illustrated when the Eastern European team Universal Fight defeated a very talented team comprised of ADCC standouts 4-3. This is a remarkable achievement. It‚Äôs impressive to win even a single match against a team of highly ranked ADCC athletes - to win a team event shows that you have talent in depth. Of the ADCC athletes Giancarlo Bodoni, Cole Abate and Dante Leon were able to win and do so via submission, but four of the Universal Athletes were able to win via points against very talented Jiu jitsu athletes and showed the world very clearly that they have arrived and are ready to compete at the highest levels. This internationalization of grappling is a very good and healthy thing for the development of the sport. It ensure the future growth of grappling both in terms of following and technical development. Each nation tends to build its own unique strengths into their game and force adaptations and evolutions that spur new growth and development among all competitors. Congratulations to Universal Fight on an excellent performance today and to @aiga.global for giving the athletes an excellent venue to show their skills

"Defensive soundness: I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve all been to a boxing match and heard fools in the audience randomly screaming ‚ÄúKEEP YOUR HANDS UP!‚Äù every twenty seconds regardless of what is actually happening in the ring. Well, underneath it all there is some wisdom. Boxer keep the hands up in order to cover the chin and make it less accessible to a blow. Observation will quickly reveal good boxers don‚Äôt always keep their hands up, but they do whenever they NEED to to. Grapplers too need to protect and cover their chin when they need to - but for different reasons. We don‚Äôt need to worry about a blow to the chin, but rather a hand/wrist sliding under the chin to set a stranglehold. As such there is a need for us also to keep our hands up as a block when appropriate to catch not punches to the jaw, but strangles UNDER the jaw. Learn to keep your hand up and ready to block - just like a good boxer you don‚Äôt want your hands always in defensive mode - otherwise it can stifle your offense a little - but when it‚Äôs needed it BADLY needed - so get those defensive hands up and ready to save you
"
"The mount is mastery: When I first began Jiu jitsu I was deeply impressed by the power of the mounted position for self defense and fighting. However, when I grappled my experience with the mount was like that of most people - it can be a frustrating position - it‚Äôs great when you can punch and elbow in a fight, but rather less useful in grappling when you can only do submissions. I felt that the mount was not as stable as side and north/south pins. It wasn‚Äôt as good for strangles as the rear mount and it had a rather limited number of submissions compared with other pins and these submissions were tricky to apply from the relatively unstable mount position. As such in my early years I didn‚Äôt spend much time working on mount skills outside of mma training. As I spent more time in the game I came to see the error of my ways. Even in grappling the mount can be a devastating position when used well. There is a reason why the two greatest Jiu jitsu pinners of all time, Roger Gracie and Gordon Ryan, used them MOUNT as their primary pin above all others. Even if you currently feel the mount isn‚Äôt your favorite position in grappling and that it‚Äôs frustrating getting reversed from there or falling off when you attempt submissions - stick with it - the long term benefits are enormous. A real sign of mastery in Jiu jitsu is the ability to get to the mount, maintain the mount against strong resistance and finish from there
"
"Making strong people weak: The human body is set up in such a way that it can only exert strength upon objects that are placed in front of it. When we have to exert strength upon objects behind us we simply can‚Äôt and have to turn ourselves around before we can attempt to do so. When you grapple strong opponents - seek to get behind them. Once you get behind an opponent he simply won‚Äôt be able to use raw strength against you - he will have to know exactly what to do if he is to get out of the position - strength alone won‚Äôt be enough. Developing the skills of getting behind opponents is arguably the single best response to the challenge of opponents who feel stronger than yourself. It does better than level the playing field - it slants the field distinctly in your favor regardless of strength disparity. Among the many skills of Jiu jitsu - the skill of slipping behind an opponent at every opportunity is the one most likely to benefit you when going against opponents with a strength advantage over you
"
"The power of strangles: There is no more certain method ending a match or indeed, a fight, than a well applied strangle. It takes time to get the position to apply it but that time will be well rewarded with the highest possible chance of victory if you can get there. Strangles are innately superior to joint locks in so far as their effects are absolutely certain. Make sure you develop at least one strangle from back and one from front that you have absolute faith in - they will surely become your primary weapons
"
"Don‚Äôt stand directly in front of dangerous opponents: The human body is set up to be at its strongest both offensively and defensively against opponents positioned directly in front of it. Just as a good boxer is very wary of standing in range directly in front of a dangerous puncher, and wisely always seeks to stay either out of range or angles off to a side whenever possible; so too, a good Jiu jitsu player is wary of staying directly in front of a dangerous guard and will use distance and angle to gain initial safety and advantage when approaching. As soon as you establish contact - LOOK TO CREATE YOUR FLANKING ANGLES AND DO AS MUCH AS YOUR WORK AS POSSIBLE WITH THE BENEFITS OF ADVANTAGEOUS ANGLE RATHER THAN DIRECTLY FACE THE PERILS OF A SKILLED OPPONENTS LEGS.
"
"In a game where control is everything - using frames to prevent an opponent from establishing controlling grips and position is a huge part of your development. The centerpiece of your frames will always be the link between your knees and elbows. The closer your opponent gets to you - the closer your knees and elbows need to be together
"
"I am very happy to announce the release today of the third and final instructional video of the FEET TO FLOOR series. This series focuses on the standing game of Jiu Jitsu in gi. This third volume focuses on aspects of the Jiu jitsu game that are of particular importance to the unique rules and demands of Jiu jitsu and which are either absent or downplayed in most grappling arts. Skills such as standing submission entries (pull to submission rather than pull to guard), a new approach to guard pulling where is it used to aggressively score rather than passively used to avoid being scored upon. How to counter guard pulls and pass in response to an opponent pulling guard. Takedown counters that put you in position to score on the ground. Remember that takedowns are only part of the standing game - there are other skills that can get better outcomes with much less risk and which can be learned very quickly - skills that can give you an effective standing game for Jiu jitsu in a short time. Check it out if you‚Äôre interested üòúüòú

"Neither of you is the same person in  the tenth minute of a tough match as you were in the first minute: Everyone feels tough in the first minute. It‚Äôs natural to be intimidated by the initial clash with an opponent who feels like Hercules when you first get a hold of him. Have faith. Understand that as time passes his strength and explosiveness will diminish. Even mental attributes such as aggression will be affected by the passage of time. Note that this goes both ways. You too, will be affected by the passage of time. Feeling of physical fatigue can start an inner voice pushing you towards panic and defeatism. Your job is control your own inner voices while activating your opponents. How to do this is a huge topic, but it starts with the simple realization that YOU MUST NOT BE OVERLY INTIMIDATED BY YOUR INITIAL ASSESSMENT OF YOUR OPPONENTS POWER AND AGGRESSION BECAUSE TIME WILL MAKE IT WANE. If your opponent feels like he has the strength and aggression of a wild animal, take heart and know that with every passing second things get better not worse. Most matches will be decided by who you and your opponent are in the tenth minute - not the first.
"
"One of the central insights of Jiu jitsu - fight them with your legs! One of the central tactical messages of Jiu Jitsu is this - whenever possible - face your opponent and grapple him with your legs. This is particularly important when underneath opponent because if you know what you‚Äôre doing the strength of your legs can make up for the usual disadvantages of being under an opponent. AS LONG AS YOU‚ÄôRE FACING YOUR OPPONENT AND HAVE YOUR LEGS BETWEEN HIM AND YOU EVERYTHING IS USUALLY OK AND YOU‚ÄôLL BE ABLE TO BOTH DEFEND AND ATTACK. The moment an opponent gets behind you or past your legs defense becomes considerably more difficult and offense is largely lost. The single biggest shift that must occur when you begin Jiu jitsu is the shift from everyday life where we are all upper body dominant; to lower body dominant on the mats. Only when this shift has been made can your jiu jitsu progress according to your potential
"
"Posture: For every task in grappling there is an ideal posture that maximizes your effectiveness and minimizes your workload. These posture vary wildly depending upon the task at hand. Sometimes it will require upright posture. Sometimes a sprinters posture. Sometimes a hunched posture. The list has as many variations as there are tasks. What works well in one scenario will perform poorly in another. Your task is to understand which posture is suited to which task and then stay as true to that ideal posture as you can until the task is completed and you switch to the next task and a new posture. If you want to know what is the ideal posture for a given task - try the task - you will quickly find that a certain posture makes it seem easier and any deviation from that posture is progressively punished depending on how far you stray from the ideal. At the end of the day this sport of ours is ultimately a game of MOVEMENT and POSTURE before anything else. The deeper your knowledge of these two elements and how they pertain to the goals of the game, the further you will go with everything else in the sport. Here, you can immediately see the positive effect of posture as Georges St Pierre switches from single leg to head inside double leg (often called a Barsargar here in the US). Good posture makes defense difficult and allows him to easily carry and move the weight of a bigger partner.
"
"Finding a diamond: There are a vast number of moves in Jiu jitsu, your job is to first master the fundamentals so that you have a strong foundation and no obvious weaknesses for an opponent to exploit, and then the fun part - selecting a small group of favorite moves that will define your game. How does this selection process occur? How do you come to choose what are to be your main weapons? There are several main methods. The first is exposure through a teaching program. I was blessed to have an excellent teacher, Renzo Gracie, who always did an excellent job of exposing us to a wide and interesting variety of moves so that we had a deep set of choices to work from. The second is talented mentors or sparring partners. Sometimes a busting athlete will come in with a new perspective or moves you aren‚Äôt familiar with but which seem very effective to you and this inspires you to emulate them. Third is watching great athletes from the past and present and being inspired by something you observe in their game. The fourth and most important is personal experimentation on the mat. Some days you try a move and find that it just clicks for you. Something about it seems more natural and easier than most moves and you apply it well from the start. When this happens, don‚Äôt ignore it. This may well be a sign that you‚Äôve stumbled on to something important. When this happens don‚Äôt just be happy with a good application of the move that day and then forget it - take it as a sign to engage in further research and study and see how far you can take that promising start!! Understand that sometimes you‚Äôll find that it leads to a dead end - better to try and lead to nothing a few times but occasionally find a diamond that can transform your game than ignore them all and go through your career with no diamonds in your collection. Next time you find that you have a natural affinity for a move, don‚Äôt just smile and forget about - see just how far you can run with it!
"
"Rising up from bottom position: Too often we have a mindset in Jiu jitsu that once we start in bottom position we have to stay there until we sweep or submit the opponent. This is unfortunate. Just because because you start in bottom position doesn‚Äôt mean you have to stay there. There are MANY occasions in sparring and competition where sufficient space develops between you and your opponent which will allow you to come up from bottom into takedowns (as opposed to conventional sweeps) and scrimmage for points in the ensuing scrambles you create - either reversing position or taking the opponents back as he tries to scramble away from the takedown. This mindset of staying down only when you are forced to stay down creates real pressure from bottom position and forces the top player to engage much more actively - this in turn makes conventional sweeps and submissions much easier, so ironically, by adding a little more wrestling into your game, your submission percentages often increase. Next time your opponent backs away from the sweeps and submissions you are using from guard position - rise up into takedowns - you will be pleasantly surprised how often this can get the score that was eluding you when an opponent is disengaging.
"
"What you look for - you will see: In Jiu jitsu as in life, if you have a preset idea of what you want and believe, you will tend to see that in whatever is in front of you. If you believe the back is among the best attacking positions in the sport and one that you seek at all times and at every opportunity - when even the smallest opportunity arises - YOU WILL SEE IT AND ATTACK IT! Have a clear idea of what you want and you‚Äôll always have a clear sense of action when the game gets heated.
"
"A balanced game: Make sure your game is evenly balanced between offense and defense. Of course we all love the idea of offense and wish that we could always be attacking - but the hard reality is that if you‚Äôre engaged with tough opponents you‚Äôll be tested every moment and it‚Äôll be the quality of your defense that determines whether you win or lose. So make sure you study deeply in defense to maintain a well balanced game. Athletes whose game has an offensive bias do well at lower levels when their offense overwhelms opponents, but struggle as they rise and have to match better opponents where they are attacked as much as they attack. Stay balanced in your training time between defense and offense.

"Early days in NYC - Mom and Dad visit: When I first came to NYC from New Zealand in 1991 (I had visited in 1988 but less than a month) it was to study Philosophy at Columbia University. New York is of course, an expensive town and the small financial stipend I got from Columbia as part of my scholarship needed supplementation, so I began working in bars and nightclubs as a bouncer. A few years later my dear Mom and Dad came all the way from New Zealand to see me - I had told them I did some extra work around town but did not tell them what it entailed üòÇüòÇ I had arranged to see them and visit the Statue of Liberty and the old World Trade Center - I lived in Harlem at the time and arranged to come downtown and meet them to be the guide. I canceled work the night before because I was worried there would be a night of fighting and I would have to show up to see them with black eyes, cuts or broken nose! üòÇüòÇAll went to plan until at 11pm I got a phone call from a bouncer friend imploring me to replace him for a family emergency at the last minute and take his spot - he had helped me in the past so I had to do it - but the promotion he was working for was legendarily violent even by early 90‚Äôs NYC standards! I showed up in the middle of a giant brawl and we fought continuously until beyond closing time at 4am! üòÇüòÇ The whole time all I thought about was not getting hit in The face üòÇüòÇ Finally the night came to closing time and I started to relax and say ‚ÄúI made it!‚Äù When a last scuffle broke out trying to get people to leave - I got hit in the back of the head with a thrown bottle and cut üòÇüòÇ Luckily in those days I had hair!! üòÇüòÇ When I woke up the next day I had a big lump, bruise and cut - but hidden underneath my hair so all was well!! üòÇüòÇ Here I am with Mom (Mum for my NZ and Aussie readers) and Dad admiring old New York with a clean face  and telling them about how safe i was in NYC studying at University üòÇüòÇ

"If you can put their weight on their heels‚Ä¶Sweeping athletic opponents is never easy, but understand this - athleticism is determined by more than genetics - on a second by second basis in a match the single biggest determinant of your athletic potential is your STANCE. It doesn‚Äôt matter how athletic you are, if your stance is compromised you will struggle to engage in athletic movement. Nobody is athletic when their weight is placed awkwardly on their heels. Even the most gifted opponents can be made to stumble and fall under those circumstances. Look to set your opponents weight on his heels when you want to knock him backwards and your task will be MUCH easier
"
"Israel Adesanya: Last night was a night of personal triumph for Mr Adesanya. He decisively defeated a career nemesis, the great Brazilian kickboxer Alex Pereira and regained his title as the best middleweight in MMA. Perhaps even more than this, Mr Adesanya furnished an extremely important lesson to the martial arts world that merit consideration. On the face of things it would seem that going into the fight last night Mr Adesanya was facing an onerous task. The two athletes had met three times before. In kickboxing, Mr Pereira won via KO and a unanimous decision. Then he followed his rival into MMA and KO‚Äôed him again to take away his title. On the surface it would seem Mr Pereira had his number. Three fights - three decisive wins. This leads us to a crucial lesson - THE RESULTS ALONE NEVER TELL THE WHOLE STORY. When most people watch a fight - they only remember the result. By that logic Mr Adesanya didn‚Äôt stand a chance last night. However, in two of this fights, Mr Adesanya had been doing extremely well before being caught by the impressive punching power of Mr Pereira. There was definitely enough in the first three fights to show that Mr Adesanya was capable of winning despite the lopsided results. Again, THE RESULTS DON‚ÄôT ALWAYS TELL THE WHOLE STORY - AND ITS THE WHOLE STORY THAT FURNISHES THE ENDING. Mr Adesanya taught us all a lesson in reading the whole story rather than the summary - don‚Äôt count yourself out based on past results alone - often the truth is much more nuanced than that - make your assessments on the whole picture to get a more real appraisal of what you can do and what you need to do. Very often you‚Äôll see that you‚Äôve got a better chance than many people believe.

"Alarm clocks and Jiu jitsu: Imagine a friend challenged you to solve a fairly complex math question within a set time. He sat you in a chair, placed some paper and a pen on the table in front of you and set a clock. Just as you begin the challenge the clock emits a loud and continuous alarm sound - perhaps someone else set the alarm earlier in the day. What‚Äôs the first step you‚Äôd take to solve this math problem? YOU WOULD TURN OFF THE DAMN ALARM!!! It‚Äôs very difficult to solve complex problems when distracted. Jiu jitsu is no different. When you go to engage with an opponent it‚Äôs always good to begin by SHUTTING DOWN THE OTHER FELLOWS GAME TO THE GREATEST DEGREE POSSIBLE BEFORE IMPOSING YOUR OWN. This means you can focus without the distraction of your opponents attacks whilst doing your thing. Work is always better without distraction - make sure your Jiu jitsu work is also done with the least possible distraction by consciously shutting down your opponents attacking options before trying to impose your own.
"
"Turtle breakdowns - start by forming an effective connection and get them out of balance (kuzushi): When you first start out working to attack turtle position it seems like an easy task - your opponent has his back to you and seems quite harmless. Then you start working against more experienced opponents and attacking turtle position seems like trying to attack a fire hydrant, then you start working with people who specialize in counter offense from this position and suddenly it feels like you are trying to ride a barrel floating down a  fast moving river. One thing is clear - you need to be connected to your opponent or they can simply move away from you. You have a bunch of good options when it comes to connection - just make sure you connect with both upper body through arms, and lower body through hips. Once this is done - GET THEM OUT OF BALANCE. The turtle position gives your opponent a surprising degree of athletic potential. They can roll, stand up, sit to guard, trap and roll you into a pin etc. Take all that away from the start by breaking their balance and suddenly the task of attacking turtle position gets a LOT easier. The only way an opponent can stop an attack on his balance is to widen his base - and that will immediately create different opportunities for your turtle attacks. Make it a habit - get connected and attack his balance - then you can choose all your other options at will

"Victory in Las Vegas!! ADCC 2022 was the greatest show in grappling history. The best of the best came and out in a show that will never be forgotten. Gordon Ryan showed why they call him the King and stands atop the grappling world. He became the first person ever to win three world titles in three different weight categories and also the first person ever to compete and win in both weight category and superfight. He beat the greatest ADCC grappler of all time, the great Andre Galvao in a passing of the torch in greatness. Giancarlo Bodoni shocked the world to win gold in the hyper competitive 88kg category in his ADCC debut - a truly incredible accomplishment. Nicholas Meregali won silver and Bronze medals in his ADCC debut after only around six months of no gi training. A truly incredible accomplishment in a world where everyone specializes in one of the other. It‚Äôs been a crazy day - I have to run now - I will write more soon to fill you in one details. I want to thank the ADCC organization and in particular @mojassim80 who worked tirelessly for a two years and massive personal expense to make this show what it was. I also want to thank all my students who elevated the performance of our competitors to a new level. I hope you all enjoyed the show!!!

"Victory in Oklahoma City! We had a great night here in OKC at the WNO Professional Grappling event. Young Davis Asare @davis_asare won his debut professional bout against the outstanding American wrestler Nick Heflin. Mr Heflin also trains Jiu jitsu and merges it very well with outstanding wrestling pedigree. Mr Asare was able to use the threat of his emerging submission skills to get dominant positions and was very nearly able to finish with a strong looking strangle hold, but Mr Heflin showed impressive mental and physical toughness to survive until time expired. Nicholas Meregali took center stage in the main event against the great two division WNO no gi champion Pedro Marinho in a gi match. Mr Marinho showed his explosive speed early and lunged for Mr Meregali‚Äôs back, but Mr Meregali has been working his defense and counter offense skills relentlessly and used these to score top position. From there he made full use of his rapidly developing top pressure game to take mounted position and finish with the only submission he allowed himself to use tonight - the triangle. His level of technical mastery is truly impressive to watch. He really does make the gi as exciting as any no gi event! Thanks so much to the fans of OKC who came out in force tonight to watch a great night of grappling! I hope you all enjoyed the show!!

"Learn to take a break: If you look at the standard of our lives you will see that typically it follows a consistent pattern of periods of work followed by shorter periods of rest where we recharge and renew, and then back to work. So for example, on an average day we work for a period of hours and then have an hour break for lunch where re relax and recharge and then return to work in the afternoon, followed by rest and dinner at home to prepare for the next day. Our week is similarly planned. We work five days in the expectation that we get two days of rest to recharge and renew and then return on Monday. Even the year is set up this way, with regular holidays set up throughout the year to create this sense of time off to recharge and get ready for a new effort upon return. This the pattern of our lives is periods of work and accomplishment followed by rest and renewal which itself is followed by a new period of effort. YOUR GRAPPLING MUST FOLLOW THE SAME PATTERN. You cannot maintain great exertion forever. Learn to work in a pattern of short bursts of hard work followed by longer periods of lower work rate and short periods of active rest. You will be surprised how many opportunities there are to take a break even during a hard fought match. This will give you a chance to recharge and start anew in your battle. When you learn to cycle your work rate between extreme effort, moderate effort and active rest you will suddenly find you can grapple for much longer periods than you could previously. Learning to mask your rest periods is a skill in itself - but one which will give you match winning endurance. You do it in every other aspect of your life - start doing it in Jiu jitsu.

"People often ask me which techniques they should focus on in training. My answer is simple. Ask yourself one question - IF YOU WERE IN THE FINALS OF THE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS, IN THE TOUGHEST MATCH OF YOUR LIFE, WHICH TECHNIQUES FROM YOUR REPERTOIRE WOULD YOU BE USING? In all honesty it would be a rather small set of trusted moves wedded together in mutual support to get the win. Focus on THOSE moves if you want to maximize the effectiveness of your training time.
"
"Kuzushi: Most Jiu jitsu student know that the act of off balancing an opponent is referred to as ‚Äúkuzushi‚Äù in Japanese. Most also realize the importance of this to set up techniques on the feet and also from bottom position on the ground. That‚Äôs all fine as a theory - but what about practice? How do you know you‚Äôve done a good job of off balancing an opponent in the heat of sparring or competition to a degree that it will be useful for your move? When working from bottom guard position the single clearest sign is simple - DID YOU MAKE YOUR OPPONENTS HAND TOUCH THE MAT? If the answer is yes - well done - he is definitely out of balance and you are ready to attack. When working your kuzushi on your opponent just try to involuntarily touch his hand to the mat and then immediately attack. Learn to do it and learn to recognize it as an important sign and your effectiveness from guard will greatly increase
"
"Making yourself stronger and opponents weaker: It‚Äôs a great thing to be physically strong and it will definitely help you in any match. As such every Jiu jitsu athlete has a responsibility to work diligently on their strength and other physical attributes. Nonetheless, the ideal of Jiu jitsu is always to put the primary focus on MAKING THE OTHER FELLOW WEAKER RATHER THAN YOURSELF STRONGER. The human body is set up in such a way that it can exhibit impressive strength in good postures, but is pathetically weak when those postures are broken. For example, you can make the strongest arm feel very weak indeed by putting it behind the strongman‚Äôs back. If you can maintain good posture while breaking that of your opponent you can create the impression of greater strength even when grappling opponents who are objectively stronger than you. You know you‚Äôre doing well when strong opponents are praising you for your strength when you know damn well they are stronger than you.
"
"Keep your hands up!!!! Every time you go to watch a boxing match there is some guy screaming at every fighter to keep their hands up. Of course there is an undeniable validity to the old cliche even if it is an over simplification with many exceptions. It expresses the need for defensive awareness and soundness - to protect the most vulnerable part of the body in a boxing match - the chin. Similarly in Jiu jitsu. We also also need to keep our hands up at times, but not to defend the chin since there is no striking - it is to defend the NECK - not from the danger of a punch, but from the danger of a STRANGLE. Make sure always to use your hand OPPOSITE the entering strangle hand if he is behind you and SAME side if he is in front of you. Keeping your hands up in these circumstances can stop small problems becoming big problems. As in boxing, don‚Äôt over do the ‚Äúhands up‚Äù philosophy - but just as in boxing, don‚Äôt under do it either - defensive soundness is the core of sensible Jiu jitsu and early neck protection is a big part of that
"
"Creating a threat: How your opponent behaves towards you in a match is closely tied to whatever perceived threat level he believes about you. The higher his assessment of your threat level - the more conservative and reserved he will be in his actions around you - the less risks he will take as he engages with you. It is important therefore, that you take every opportunity to create attacking threats at all times during a match. Make sure that your defensive skills are closely followed by counterattack and that any indecision on his part is ruthlessly attacked by you. Positional threat is good, but submission threat usually creates a higher threat level, so make sure you have some favorite submission attacks for every scenario.
"
"Doubling your chances: For every ten times you try to sweep someone your own size and skill level from guard position, you can expect around seven to eight of them to fail due to a skilled opponents anticipation and resistance. Knowing this it is very important that you build the habit of rising up from bottom position and following a failed sweep with an attempted takedown. This gives you a second chance to reverse your opponent and take top position. Most beginners have a tendency to sit back down after a failed sweep - do the opposite - rise up into a follow up takedown and you‚Äôll find that you double your chances of a score without adding a lot of effort. Interestingly these follow up takedowns tend to be easier than normal takedowns for the simple reason that the opponents stance and balance is usually broken by the initial sweep attempt, making takedown defense more difficult than usual. Next time you‚Äôre sweeping from guard, start that building that habit of coming UP rather than just sitting back down.
"
"One of the great honors of my coaching career was to be involved with the two best ever in their respective arts - Georges St Pierre in MMA and Gordon Ryan in grappling. Watching these two incredible athletes get to the top from quiet and unknown beginnings to be the best of the best was truly an honor. It was amazing them work together on the mat today and learn from each other about technique and tactics in ways that cross over between their respective sports. Jiu jitsu and MMA have always had a close relationship. I still believe that the fundamental appeal of Jiu jitsu is tied directly to fighting, even though they sometimes seem very far apart in some aspects of Jiu jitsu competition. The closer we keep them the healthier for the long term direction of Jiu jitsu. Congratulations to both men for the incredible success they‚Äôve had in their respective disciplines, thank you for the inspiration you have generated and the lessons you have shown; and wonderful to see them both in action again on the mats!
"
"Continuity: We judge our Jiu jitsu mostly by the quality of our performance of moves - but in truth, the more important factor is the quality of the CONTINUITY BETWEEN OUR MOVES. For one move to work against high level opponents it must be perfect. But if you can string moves together in sequences the pressure of multiple attacks compounds their effect on an opponent and makes a breakthrough much more likely. Once you feel you‚Äôve reached competence in performing a move, immediately start investigating ways to team it up smoothly with others so that you develop a good sense of continuous attack - because that will be the more important thing quality to win tough matches
"
"Sweeps AND submissions: Very often there is a natural tendency to divide our attacks from open guard into sweeps and submissions and to see them as as an either/or option - you either sweep the opponent or you submit him. There is nothing wrong with that, but you will get much better results when you understand that they operate best when used in unison. Every time you attack with a sweep, your opponent will be forced to base out with his limbs to prevent it. This will immediately created extended limbs - and extended limbs are breakable limbs. THE MORE YOU CAN GET AN OPPONENT EXTENDED AND OUT OF BALANCE, THE MORE YOU WILL SUBMIT HIM. Don‚Äôt see sweeps as an alternative choice to submissions - see them as an essential precursor - and watch your submission percentages increase overnight. Here, Gordon Ryan launches an opponent into some serious air time at the world championships. A sweep attack as powerful as this will either result in sweep points or at the very least, an extended and off balanced opponent who can easily be attacked via submission at both upper and lower body.
"
"Vertebrates: The most fundamental feature of our human bodies is our vertebrate nature - our bodies are completely dominated by our most basic structure - a spine connected to our skull. Everything is connected to this. Because the head is at the end of the spine and the spine functions as a lever - HE WHO CONTROLS THE END OF THE LEVER - THE HEAD - CONTROLS THE WHOLE BODY. There are many ways as to HOW you can control the head from standing and ground, top or bottom. There are even more variables as to WHEN you can control the head based on your position relative to your opponent. Never lose track of the fact that the best overall way to control a human is through their head. Look for it whenever possible and learn when it‚Äôs available and when it‚Äôs not. You can do it more easily when an opponent is wearing a gi jacket since it functions like a rope around the neck, but there are plenty of great ways to do without a gi also - either way - make it one of the primary goals of your grappling style
"
"The single most important desiderata with sweeps and takedowns is to begin by BREAKING YOUR OPPONENTS STANCE. If you can do that, you‚Äôll be able to takedown even very athletic people, if you can‚Äôt, you‚Äôll not only likely fail but be strongly countered by good opponents. No one is strong or athletic in a broken stance. Break his stance and his balance will soon follow.
"
"Big Weekend coming up! The second biggest grappling event of the year is on this weekend with @flograppling WNO Grappling super fight featuring the main event Gordon Ryan vs Felipe Pe√±a. The co main event is also a fascinating match up between Rafael Lavato Jr, one of the greatest grapplers of his generation and a master of jiu jitsu in gi and no gi and also in MMA. He will take on Brazilian superstar Nicholas Meregali in what should a truly great match up. Mr Meregali has only had two no gi matches in his career and had never even trained without a gi until around five months ago, but he has been training hard alongside Mr Ryan and making great progress. He has brilliant overall movement and an attacking style that he transfers over from his stellar gi game and now must try to apply it against an ADCC legend! I‚Äôm really looking forward to this match - I‚Äôve seen both train up close and they are both extraordinary athletes with very different styles - watching the clash of those styles will be fascinating!
"
"Tension and relaxation: Jiu jitsu is a game that requires from us great variations in states of muscular tension and relaxation. If you‚Äôre too tense too long you will quickly exhaust yourself and your movements will be stiff and inefficient. Too relaxed too long and you won‚Äôt be able to hold and control a wildly resisting opponent when pinning him or going for submission attempts. Different scenarios require different physical dispositions in terms of muscular effort. The LESS CONTACT with an opponent the LOWER the tension level. The more you engage in MOVEMENT the LOWER the tension levels. The more you engage in STOPPING movement the HIGHER the tension levels. Use these simple rules to guide your degree of muscular tension so that you can exhibit good endurance and good movement quality while at the same able to lock someone in place with sufficient control to pin opponents and finish them.
"
"Position and standing technique: From the first day you begin Jiu jitsu you got told the importance of POSITION. Probably you were told that position is more important than anything else and should precede (upper body) submissions. There is a reason why you were told this - because in the vast majority of cases it is true. However, when you were shown standing techniques, all the talk about position was abandoned. You were just shown some random takedowns and told to do them from wherever you were. This is a mistake. THERE ARE JUST AS MANY DEMANDS AND NUANCES IN THE STANDING GAME AS THERE ARE IN THE GROUND GAME - and just like the ground game, getting good position first makes applying the techniques much easier and more successful. Just as position usually precedes (upper body) submission on the floor, position precedes most takedowns on the feet. So what are the dominant positions in the standing game? There are several, but the one I always like to teach first is to constantly seek to get a dominant position OUTSIDE YOUR OPPONENTS ELBOWS. If you can get an advantageous position outside an opponents elbows, most takedown techniques will be easier to apply. When you go to grip up with your opponent - seek to get outside his elbows and either attack directly from there or as your opponent tries to recover and square up with you - having that initial positional advantage will make the takedowns so much easier to apply. Don‚Äôt think that position is just something that only applies to the ground game. It‚Äôs just as valuable on the feet. Start your journey with the idea of seeking always to get outside your opponents elbows and play from there
"
"Getting under an opponents center of gravity is the key to any lifting throw or sweep: sweeps come in different forms - some are trips, some are like wrestling takedowns, some involve getting behind the opponent.  The biggest and most impressive looking sweeps are those where you get under an opponent and lift - these create amplitude and flip an opponent over straight to his back. It‚Äôs important to focus on two things. First, get under your opponent. Second, keep contact with the floor with the other foot and your same side shoulder so that you can create drive off the floor and create power out of your lifting position. When you can do this you can get the kind of amplitude you see Gordon Ryan exhibit here at the World Championships.
"
"Position and your mindset: The ideal of Jiu jitsu is control leading to submission. The most well known form of control is POSITIONAL CONTROL, where an athlete advances to the major scoring pins of Jiu jitsu which give him a greater ability to control and attack an opponent than the opponent has return fire. Your mindset when you achieve positional control tells you everything you need to know about yourself and your Jiu jitsu. When you get into a dominant pin, do you see that as AN END ITSELF? Or AS A MEANS TO AN END (submission)? If you celebrate the POSITION and see THAT as a victory, you will never express the ideal of Jiu jitsu. If you see the position merely as a step towards submission, then you have the mindset that produces the ideal of Jiu jitsu. Once you get to the position it‚Äôs fine to take some time to establish control, tire an opponent, switch to another position etc, but inside your mind you must already be tirelessly searching how to go beyond the positional victory and on to the submission victory and thus to align yourself with the ideal of the sport. Here, Gordon Ryan goes beyond basic positional control from the back into a masterful arm trap that sets up multiple submission opportunities and creates a path from positional control to submission

"Daniel Manasoiu wins ADCC Open in Vancouver: Big Dan @jiujitsugiant continued his impressive run at the ADCC Open events of 2023 winning his eighth gold medal with another double gold in heavyweight and absolute divisions with almost all wins via submission.  It‚Äôs great to see these events giving young athletes the chance to develop experience in the ADCC rule set in preparation for the real thing at ADCC trials coming up over the next few months. Well done Dan!!
"
"Observation: There is only so much hard physical training you can do in a day before you break yourself. If you want to increase your training time without adding to your physical load - TRAIN YOUR MIND THROUGH OBSERVATION. You can train your mind for many hours a day with no danger of over training or injury. It is the perfect addition to your physical training and a fine replacement for physical training if you are injured or sick. Train yourself to watch matches and learn. Most people watch only for entertainment. They watch to see who wins. This is unimportant. What is important is not WHO wins but HOW they won and lost. Train yourself to look for THIS and you can double or triple your training time in a day by adding a non physical element. As the old saying goes - the hardest work is hard thinking. Thinking can‚Äôt be a substitute for hard physical work - but it is a very fine addition to it. Don‚Äôt just watch - WATCH FOR A PURPOSE - learn to see why some win and some lose and take those mental lessons to your next physical training session - you‚Äôll be surprised how much they can add to your progress.
"
"You‚Äôve got five grappling limbs - use them all: we think of ourselves as four limbed creatures, but in grappling your head can be used to push and pull an opponent just like your arms and legs - your goal is to maximize and integrate your use of all five. Grappling is all about connection to your opponent so that you can exert whatever forces you have upon him. Your limbs are the spearhead of that connection. Here, Garry Tonon uses his right hand to shut down his opponents left. His right foot to maintain distance. His left foot to threaten his opponents base and his left arm/hand to prevent his opponent gaining an underhook - and while all this is going on, his head is used to maintain his seated stance. That image of simultaneous and automatic use of all five limbs is what you must strive for as you grapple. Your torso is your engine, but your five limbs are the transmission that enable you to apply that power to your opponent
"
"The results you get will not be determined by how many moves you know but rather by how many you have the confidence to use in those heavy moments where your own mind is screaming at you to avoid the risk of moving. Ten moves in which you have confidence to use any time and anywhere will be of more value than a thousand in which you have a passing knowledge but in which you lack the confidence to use when it counts
"
"The central theme of Jiu jitsu bottom position - fight them with your legs: In most grappling arts bottom position is seen as inherently inferior. Jiu jitsu is one of the few that sees bottom position as neutral. The central message of jiu jitsu with regards top position is simple but profound. The great advantage of bottom position is that your legs can be used to grapple your opponent. When in top you have to use your legs as a base of support. When on bottom facing your opponent either on your butt or back your legs bear no weight so that you can use them them to engage the opponent rather than the floor. Because your legs are considerably stronger and with far greater endurance than your upper body, this means that someone fighting from bottom with their legs has a great chance against someone fighting from top mostly with their arms. Understand of course, that the top athlete has their advantages too. They have the power of gravity on their side. Learn to work with this central theme of Jiu jitsu in mind at all times. When playing bottom position focus primarily on ATTACKING THEM WITH YOUR LEGS. Make your legs the center of your bottom game and you‚Äôll see that bottom position in grappling offers as many opportunities as top
"
"Daniel Manasoiu victorious in Ottawa at ADCC Open! Big Dan Manasoiu had a sensational day at the Ottawa ADCC Open today winning double gold - nine matches six submissions - to show how much progress his game has made in recent months. Mr Manasoiu is a heavyweight who moves like a lightweight - I train heavyweights the same way I train lightweights as I believe many people have a tendency to underestimate what big people can do in terms of agility and movement - Mr Manasoiu is a good example of this. Now he heads to California for the next ADCC Open in Costa Mesa next weekend - there are many talented athletes booked for that event so keep your eyes on that one! Well done Daniel!!
"
"Control first or submission threat first? When attacking the back, we are normally always taught to establish position first, strangle second. There is a lot of wisdom to this approach. For most people, most of the time, it is the best option. Why? First, Because position scores, and you being ahead on points means the opponent must now take greater risks to escape and get his own scores. Those risks will make him more vulnerable to subsequent attacks. Second, position allows you to make repeated attacks over time. So if you experience initial failure you get to make second, third or fourth attempts at will until you achieve the breakthrough. Third, punishing positions like rear mount can fatigue an opponent over time and make later strangles easier. For these and other reasons it‚Äôs usually a good idea to focus on securing the position first and worry about strangles later. However, one problem with this approach that often appears at championship level is that opponents are mentally and physically tough (won‚Äôt fatigue or quit over time), tactically smart (often will prevent a score by denying a hook) and skilled at hand fighting defenses (can hold off many attacks over long stretches of time). In these cases it is often better to attack the strangle in those vital half seconds BEFORE you establish the position as your opponent is primarily concerned with defending the position and will often leave the neck momentarily open. Interestingly, his panicked reaction to a strong initial strangle threat will often make the subsequent battle for position easier. Flicking your wrist under his chin very early on in the attack can be a good alternative strategy to employ in these situations
"
"Jiu jitsu in a nutshell: Sometimes it‚Äôs very helpful to have a simple set of instructions that can cover a lot of complex ground and give you a clear sense of direction when complexity makes things foggy. For me, Jiu jitsu always comes down to three major directives 
1 - When in bottom position always strive to keep your legs (guard) between you and your opponent 
2 - When in top position always strive to get past your opponents legs (guard) and into upper body pins. 
3 - Always seek to get behind your opponent whenever possible. 
  These simple rules express the main tactical desiderata of Jiu jitsu. Almost all the myriad techniques of the game are just a means to these ends. In time you will learn exceptions to these rules. You will learn to exploit an opponents overly strict adherence to them; but at the start of your journey they are the compass that will give you good direction in the chaos and confusion of sparring. In some ways the game is very complex, but at its core it is very simple. You can learn these three simple rules in less than a minute and they can guide you for a lifetime
"
"Consistently Winning the little battles usually means you‚Äôll win the war: A Jiu jitsu match is a series of little battles leading to progressively better situations until a point is reached where the opponent does not want to or cannot continue - then the war is over. This simple fact should be reflected in your training. If you want to mimic match conditions seek to win all the little battles along the way - the initial hand fights, the transition to the ground and subsequent grip fights, the battle to off balance an opponent if you‚Äôre on bottom or nullify the legs if you‚Äôre on top. In a competitive match these battles will go back and forth - focus on winning bad many as you can and generally the final result will go your way. Most Jiu jitsu matches are won CUMULATIVELY. Onlookers only remember the RESULT, but in truth, most of the time it was taking the majority of all those little battles for grip, angle and position that determined the outcome before the finish. Fight in the light of this truth. Don‚Äôt get complacent over small battles - they all count toward the final result. Stay focused and be greedy - the more little battles you take the easier and quicker you win the overall war.
"
"Control of the head and arm is real control: You will often hear people say that he who controls the head controls the whole body. It‚Äôs absolutely true. Arguably the best form of head control is HEAD AND ARM control. In JiuJitsu you get two great ways to do this. The first is through the ARMS via FRONT HEADLOCK when you‚Äôre in front of people and SEAT BELT when you‚Äôre behind people. The second is through the LEGS via TRIANGLE (sankaku) variations. Both are incredibly effective and opponent up a large number of really high percentage submission holds while simultaneously offering unusually high degree of control over movement. Train your mind to see not just a head in front of you - but a HEAD AND ARM and use either your arms or legs to lock it up.  Very soon you will notice that you are controlling and finishing people that used to be impervious to your attacks.
"
"Going from good to great - The example of Craig Jones and triangles: It‚Äôs perfectly natural and good to find that certain moves seem more natural for you than others and that your progress with them exceeds that of other moves. Often this is a reflection of your personality and body type, sometimes it‚Äôs due to the coaching program you work under. My point today is that whatever these favorite moves of yours are - are you maximizing your progress with them? A natural fault we all have is to think that if we  are good at something then that‚Äôs good enough, and we remain satisfied with that level. I always counsel my athletes that if they are GOOD at something, then that‚Äôs a clear sign that they can become GREAT at it, with just a little extra work. When Craig Jones started training full time with the squad a couple of years ago, he had a really good front triangle. Anytime you join a new gym it‚Äôs natural to be impressed by what they‚Äôre good at so he spent a lot of time improving his back, front headlock, arm bar and leg attacks - but through it all I always pushed him to expand his already strong triangle skills in new directions. Instead of just using front triangles he started adding rear triangles and side triangles and reverse triangles. He started making his right front triangle as good as his left. Soon his triangle attacks became such a concern to his training partners that his leg lock percentages doubled as they tried desperately to get away from the dangerous triangles. It‚Äôs an excellent example of how you can take something you feel you are good at, and double or triple your effectiveness with it by really making it a focus of study. If you have a natural propensity for something, there is a very good chance that you can take it a LOT further than you currently have, and that when you do, it will open other door of progress as well. So follow the example of Craig Jones - take those skills you are good at, and a make a plan to take them further and become great at them.

"Counting down: Tomorrow night in Austin Texas @flograppling will host a fantastic night of grappling. Headlining the event will be a bout between two jiu jitsu icons - Kaynan Duarte and Nicholas Meregali. This will be their first no gi encounter. Mr Meregali is a pyrotechnical submission hunter - one of the best in the sports history - but Mr Duarte is one of the best athletes in the sports history and a superb tactician who has two ADCC gold medals to prove it - this will be a great match! Teenage phenom Helena Crevar will take on exciting Australian grappling prospect Healy Dayan a student of Australian grappling legend Lachlan Giles who now trains at B team - she has shown a very strong positional game in competition here in the US so this match should be excellent! Oliver Taza will take on Sebastian Rodriguez on short notice. Oliver has been on fire in ADCC Open competition and will bring that good form to the arena tomorrow. There are many other great matches on the card featuring legends like Felipe Pena, Nicky Ryan and Dante Leon - keep your eyes on this one - it will be üî•üî•üî•

"Ashi waza!! There‚Äôs nothing like a foot sweep to show the true nature of Jiu jitsu. Of all the techniques in Jiu jitsu, judo and wrestling, it‚Äôs hard to beat foot sweeps for the best expression of maximum efficiency and best results for effort expended. That feeling of catching an opponent mid step on a weightless leg and letting gravity do the work for you is the best feeling in the sport. Most takedowns are grueling affairs with a lot of effort and risk involved. Foot sweeps minimize risk and maximize reward like nothing else. They can be a little frustrating initially as there is some timing skill involved, but like all good things - the potential rewards more than justify the delay in gratification - make them part of your skill set!!
"
"Taking yourself to a new level - front headlocks and the example of Craig Jones: At any given time our game is certain level. This can change a little week by week depending upon training conditions and the state of our body, but there is a rough level that can be roughly measured by your skill set/knowledge and how you stack up against other athletes in sparring/competition. Once you can to a level that you find satisfactory it‚Äôs natural to take stock of yourself and see yourself as having a certain type of game. Both you and Your classmates have a good idea of what your strengths and weaknesses are. You see yourself as being good at moves A,B and C but not very interested in E and F. You take that skill set of yours and refine it a little and that‚Äôs you. You can do pretty well with this approach - but you will never reach your potential. You have to periodically set projects to add whole new aspects to your game. This is the only way to avoid stagnation over time. Take the example of Craig Jones. Early in his career he was known primarily for his triangle attacks. When he came to America to compete in EBI events he realized he had to excel in the leg lock game. He took that project on with such gusto that he became known as one of the best in the world. Not satisfied, he went on to develop a very powerful back attack in response to opponents who ran from the pressure of his leg game. Watching his development a few years ago i talked with him about the need to develop a powerful front headlock/Guillotine game as a counter to opponents who did not want to engage his dangerous submissions game or who were faster than him in a scramble. Immediately he took the project on. Within a short time he was developing lethal variations of Guillotines, anacondas and Darce strangles. Then tying these back to his already formidable back game and leg game. Now he has one of the best front headlock games I‚Äôve ever seen! THIS is how you keep developing. NEVER SEE YOURSELF AS A COMPLETED PROJECT. Rather than cover up and hide your weaknesses - train them to become your new strengths and ally them to your old strengths.
"
"Control his hands and wrists and it‚Äôll be difficult for him to control you: The basis of connection in Jiu jitsu is the HANDS and FEET. It is through these that we begin to connect to an opponent in ways that enable us to use the more powerful legs, hips and core to actually move an opponent around, but it all begins with hands and feet. It stands to reason then, that if you can control an opponent‚Äôs hands, it will be difficult for him to connect effectively to you. Best of all is when you can consistently control his hands to shut down his attempts at connection, whilst at the same time you are able to quickly transition to your own effective grips so that you shut down his offense while enabling your own. When you come out to grapple, start at the the opponents hands and wrists and you‚Äôll negate his offense while setting up your own
"
"Bad position? Stance first - escape second: We all know that when you get caught in a bad position in Jiu jitsu the onus is on us to escape. Escape takes time however; and in that time, a good opponent will use that position to attack us with submissions. Therefore your first responsibility in bad position is not escape, but rather, STANCE. You must adopt an appropriate defensive stance that reduces the possibility of an opponent submitting you and which facilitates your eventual escape. Initial Failures in defensive stance make it almost impossible to employ the escapes you know and make it much more likely you‚Äôll be tapping rather than escaping. When caught in a bad position start by getting your hands, elbows and knees inside your opponents hands, elbows and hips to the greatest degree that you can. Off balancing an opponent with bridging, bumping and kipping helps this a lot. Once your arms and legs are inside your opponents you will find escape is considerably easier and there is a lot less danger of getting submitted. Here, Gordon Ryan finds himself in a bad situation and has immediately positioned his left arm safely. His right elbow however, is still trapped outside his opponents hip. Before he can even think of escape he will have to off balance his opponent a little and pull that elbow inside to a position of safety from where he can start his escape. Next time you‚Äôre in a bad position - start with recovering your defensive stance - only then will the escapes you‚Äôve been working on prove effective
"
"Hard work becomes easier when it‚Äôs done from a good stance: Jiu jitsu is a game played out in various scenarios. Sometimes you are standing in neutral, sometimes in various kinds of tie up, sometimes you‚Äôre in bottom half guard, seated butterfly guard - the list is quite long with many variation (but don‚Äôt worry it‚Äôs not impossibly long). For each one of those scenarios there is an appropriate stance that maximizes your efficiency and reduces your workload. The faster you get to that stance, maintain it as long as appropriate and change to a new appropriate stance in the face of changing circumstances - the less work you will have to do. At first these stances will seem tiring and frustrating; you won‚Äôt be able to hold them very long and sometimes forget to hold them at all - but your long term success is completely bound up with your ability to know them and hold them. Initial failures in stance almost always lead to later failures in technique and endurance. When you practice scenarios in Jiu jitsu; make a habit of start in good stance. Focus on the stance first and the techniques second. If you aren‚Äôt sure what the appropriate stance is, your instructor will know. If there is time and it‚Äôs appropriate ask him or her the REASONING behind that stance - when you know WHY to stand or sit or kneel or lie down a certain way it‚Äôs usually easier to recall next time.
"
"The first minute of a match can feel very intimidating. Your opponent often feels immensely strong and fast and your first attempts at your moves often can‚Äôt even get started - forget about completed. Take heart. If you stay active and impose a work rate on your opponent that exceeds your own work rate time will work in your favor. An athlete whose stance seemed impregnable in the first minute will very often feel quite a lot weaker, slower and more open to attack in seventh, eighth or ninth minute. Fatigue can totally change the character of your opponent. Don‚Äôt lose heart when the first minute feels tough - everybody is tough in the first minute. Focus on taking the match to a point where that initial toughness fades to a level where an opponent who initially felt like he could stop all your attacks, now can‚Äôt stop any of them. Pressure and time can be your worker enemies when used well against you, and your best friends when you are in charge of them - use them whenever you can

"Win one battle at a time: When you are caught in a bad situation in jiu jitsu it is unlikely that you‚Äôll immediately and effortlessly escape. After all, if your opponent is good enough to force you in to a bad position, he‚Äôs probably good enough to keep you there. Instead, FOCUS ON WINNING SMALLER BATTLES FIRST THAT DIMINISH THE CONTROL YOUR OPPONENT HAS OVER YOU. As you win a series of smaller battles that weaken your opponents control, THEN you can win the big battle and get out of the situation altogether. For example, if you‚Äôre caught in a heavy side pin, don‚Äôt just try to blast out of there. Start by winning a smaller battle - the battle for an under hook. If you‚Äôre opponent gets an under hook , he solidifies his control over you. If you get an under hook, you rob him of control over your torso. Then win the battle for the cross face. If you get your head inside his cross face he loses control of your head. Now you‚Äôve won two minor battles and your opponent no longer controls the movement of your head and torso. Now win the battle for positioning - a bridge removes your opponent from direct chest to chest position, rendering his weight ineffective. Once these three minor battle are won - NOW YOU‚ÄôRE IN A STATE WHERE YOU CAN ESCAPE THE POSITION OVERALL. At this point you can pick and choose among the escapes - elbow escape, knee escape, whatever you want. Next time you‚Äôre in trouble, take on the mind set of identify the minor battles you need to win first before you win the big one.

"The great @danaherjohn shows the Fundamentals of Guard Passing in todays Daily Deal at the link in bio. üëÄ
"
"No one ever said your back has to stay on the ground: When we first start learning guard position we typically start in supine positions (usually closed guard in most coaching programs). Because we START there we usually tend to STAY  there. This can become a problem when an opponent starts passing your guard. As they gain angle and distance and threaten to pass there are many times when it‚Äôs a good idea to get up off your back to stage some last ditch resistance and recover. You don‚Äôt always have to do this - but when an opponent is very close to passing it‚Äôs often a good idea to get up off your back and post on your elbow or hand to get your shoulders off the mat. This will first, prevent an opponent cleanly pinning your shoulders and head to the mat and completing the pass. Second, give you greater mobility to recover your leg position and put your opponent back in your guard. Like everything in Jiu jitsu (and life) it comes at a price. You can expose your back  to a rear mount specialist and your waist to a body lock passing specialist - but sometimes you have to take a risk to prevent a score. If you feel opponents are passing too easily try propping yourself up on hand or elbow to give yourself the mobility you need to recover.
"
"Resistance: We never really know for sure what moves our opponent will do in a match - but one thing we DO know for sure is that he will resist every one of OUR moves. Learning to OVERCOME and MOVE AROUND resistance is a lifelong study in Jiu jitsu. No one cares how beautiful your moves look with a cooperative training partner during drills - what really counts is how successful you are at applying them in a competitive setting on a skilled opponent who doesn‚Äôt want to lose. This will require skills in SET UP. If you can disguise the entry to your moves in some way, then execution will be easier. It will requires skill in COMBINING MOVES, if you can follow a failed move with a second or third follow up, your opponent will often fail to follow the change in direction in time and be caught. Learning to disguise your intent and work in combinations are the two best ways to counter resistance in all combat sports - Jiu jitsu is no exception. Be sure to imbed your power moves in creative set ups and combinations and the principle problem of sparring - overcoming resistance - will be much easier
"
"Getting work done: It‚Äôs late night here in LA and Giancarlo Bodoni @giancarlobodoni is getting ready for his title match against powerhouse title holder 205 pound WNO champion Pedro Merinho. With him is Aussie grappling icon Kit Dale @kitdaleofficial who very generously comes in every night to help preparation. Its always a great feeling for me to connect with Australians in Jiu jitsu and Kit Dale has a been a great representative for many years so it was a pleasure to work with him!
"
"There is no one move, no one position that confers guarantees of victory. In a world where every move has a counter what confers victory is THE QUALITY OF EXECUTION OF A SERIES ON INTEGRATED MOVES AND POSITIONS AT A RATE THAT IS FASTER THAN YOUR OPPONENTS COUNTERS - this is the path to victory
"
"When you‚Äôre winning - take your time: In Jiu jitsu it pays to get out of bad situations as quickly as possible. The longer you stay there, the worse things typically get. Good situations on the other hand, allow you to take your time. In most cases good position creates enervating pressure, so the longer you dwell there, the better things get. So as a general rule - when things are bad, move quickly to rectify them; when things are good - slow things down and let time and pressure work in your favor so that you can turn a good situation into a great one
"
"Pressure: when we think of winning in Jiu jitsu we typically think in terms of MOVES. If a move is performed flawlessly it wins a match. In reality however, we rarely perform moves flawlessly against the strong resistance of an opponent who has the similar knowledge, skill and size to ourselves. Typically what determines winner and loser is PRESSURE OVER TIME. it is the ACCUMULATION of moves performed to a level that stresses an opponent that wears him down first physically and then mentally. As time  passes his ability to counter your moves deteriorates faster than your ability to perform them. Learning to use pressure as a weapon is perhaps the single biggest factor in your effectiveness on the mat. You START Jiu jitsu learning MOVES, but you will FINISH it learning to impose and maintain PRESSURE.

"Seminar in Austin Texas Friday 7pm July 16: Gordon Ryan and I will teach a big seminar in conjunction with @flograppling The squad always gets a great reception in Texas so we are really looking forward to this! I have always been proud of the way my senior students have a general shared philosophy of Jiu jitsu that they showcase so brilliantly in competition but at the same time they each are outstanding creative minds who come up with their brilliant variations and innovations so that each has a distinctive style within our team style. A big part of my coaching program is teaching not just skill for competition, but teaching as a skill in itself. As a result all my senior students excel at teaching just as they do at competition. Teaching alongside them is always a pleasure - if you‚Äôre in Austin come by and see us! It will be a fun night of technique and squad philosophy! üòúüòúcontact @flograppling for tickets!!

"What have you gained today and what do you need tomorrow? Whenever the workout ends it natural to just relax and joke around and talk about your favorite topics (sex and violence). That‚Äôs fine - that kind of behavior builds class camaraderie that is crucial to long term development. But occasionally it‚Äôs good to delay the after class shenanigans a little and get a clear sense of what you learned about your game today and what you need to work on tomorrow. There are many factors that go into making a good workout, but perhaps the most important is the most over looked - A SENSE OF PURPOSE. When you go into a workout with a clear sense of WHAT YOU WANT TO ACCOMPLISH - not necessarily today but in the future - you will invariably get more done and make greater progress than if you just show up and follow whatever happens in class. Take a proactive approach to workouts and enter with the expectation of trying to achieve something rather than a reactive approach of just following the tide and see what happens. Substantive Talk with team mates after class is a a great way to start this - then you can get back to the sex and violence  afterwards üòúüòÇ
"
"Gentlemen: There is an odd gentleman‚Äôs agreement in jiu jitsu that there is a top player who passes guard and a bottom player who works from guard to sweep or submit his opponent. Typically the bottom player stays on bottom until he either sweeps or submits the other fellow. THERE IS NOTHING IN THE RULE BOOK THAT SAYS IF YOU START ON BOTTOM UIU HAVE TO STAY ON BOTTOM. You add a whole new dimension to your bottom game when you constantly threaten to rise up from bottom and threaten takedowns and hip heists to top position. Ironically this will force your opponent to close distance and pass with more pressure - which makes it easier to apply a conventional submissions and sweep guard game. Next time you‚Äôre playing from guard - make sure you threaten to come up into takedowns and snaps to front head lock - you‚Äôll be amazed at how it benefits your bottom game
"
"Control makes opponents predictable: When an opponent stands in front of you it‚Äôs anybody‚Äôs guess what his next action will be. If you have no physical control over him he can do whatever he wants. The second you put hands on him you now exert a degree of control - and as a result, his options shrink. The more control you exert over his movements, the fewer options he has as to what his next move will be - and the fewer options he has - THE MORE PREDICTABLE HE BECOMES - and an opponent whose next move can be accurately predicted is a MUCH easier opponent to defeat. Thus ever increasing physical control is the key to taking the unknown out of combat and creating a sense that you know what your opponent will do next. Once you can accurately predict the next move from a very limited set of possible options that an opponent must choose from, then you can make yourself look like a Jiu jitsu oracle who can foretell an opponent‚Äôs next move - that‚Äôs when Jiu jitsu becomes something special. There‚Äôs nothing mystical about it - it‚Äôs based on physical control - levers, fulcrums and wedges - but its effects appear magical
"
"Weigh in complete: Gordon Ryan and Felipe Pe√±a both weighed in for the main event tomorrow night. Mr Pe√±a came in at 228 pounds and Mr Ryan at 227. Now all the athletes will engage in a press conference. The undercard alone for this event is better than most main events with Brazilian phenoms Mica Galvao, and both winners of Brazilian trials Fabricio Andrey getting ready for big matches. B team sensation Jay Rodriguez will take on rising star Jacob Couch from Daisy Fresh. Bia Misquita, the great ADCC champion will go against Elizabeth Clay. This is a super event - no question!
"
"Clarity of purpose: I truly believe that one of the great reasons why classical Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is so successful as a martial art is it‚Äôs incredibly simple and clear basic directive. You can explain it to a total neophyte in two minutes and it‚Äôll make intuitive sense to him. In fact it‚Äôs so clear that I believe if you took two completely untrained people with no fighting experience of similar size and strength and explained the basic directive of Jiu jitsu to one of them but not the other, the one who had been taught that basic directive would have a considerably higher chance of victory if they fought each other, not because he has gained any skill - he hasn‚Äôt - but just because he now has an effective and proven SENSE OF DIRECTION while the other only has his instincts. When one person has a sense of direction and purpose in a crises and the other doesn‚Äôt - I‚Äôll put my money on the fellow with a sense of direction and purpose every time. What is this basic directive of Jiu jitsu? It can be stated in a single sentence. WORK YOUR WAY TO THE MOUNTED POSITION OR REAR MOUNTED POSITION AND FINISH YOUR OPPONENT. It doesn‚Äôt matter whether it‚Äôs grappling or fighting. If you follow that simple directive and have the skills to do it against the resistance of your opponent - you‚Äôll be a very difficult challenge indeed. Remember always that every rule, point allocation, recommendation, technique and tactic of Jiu jitsu Bia just a means to satisfying this basic directive. Never lose sight of its clarity and you‚Äôll always know what to do and how to train and prepare.
"
"You always go out alone: Jiu jitsu is an odd sport insofar as it is practiced as a group but when it‚Äôs time to perform it‚Äôs you and you alone who steps out in the mat. You can be surrounded by your friends, coaches and teammates but when your name is called it‚Äôs only you that walks out. This dichotomy between the social aspect of group training and the inner loneliness of your solo performance is at the heart of your Jiu jitsu experience. It manifests itself in athletes in dramatic ways - some athletes excel in the gym and struggle on the stage. Others look ordinary in the gym and shine on stage. The main thing is to grasp the significance of the fact that ultimately you can be given all manner of advice, comfort and encouragement by everyone you know - but it‚Äôs YOU and you like who will have to perform - so make sure you develop a game that suits YOU and and that your game is an expression of who YOU are - not anyone else. Just as you can easily see when a person is not comfortable inside their own skin, you can easily see when an athlete is not comfortable with their own game or match persona. So when it‚Äôs time to build your game - yes it‚Äôs good to take advice and learn from the experience of others - but don‚Äôt do so to the extent that your game is more an expression of someone else‚Äôs Jiu jitsu than your own, because when your name is called they won‚Äôt be coming out on the mat with you
"
"Study: You are engaged in a sport where one seemingly small detail can mean the difference between a move working or not, and where if a move works it can mean winning and if it doesn‚Äôt - losing. So study deeply. Many athletes are not afraid of hard physical work, but shy away from hard mental work. Your work doesn‚Äôt end when class is over - that‚Äôs when study time begins. Get that one insight that improves your performance in a key area and your performance tomorrow may benefit immensely. Hard mental work makes the physical work much easier!
"
"The workout isn‚Äôt over when your BODY stops moving - it‚Äôs over when your MIND stops moving. After every workout there is a time to analyze and recall what you did well, what you did poorly and how you can use those insights to create a better you tomorrow on the mats - use it!

"Turtle position - the OTHER bottom position of Jiu jitsu: When people talk about playing bottom position in Jiu Jitsu, they almost always mean to play from GUARD position, which is defined as a situation where you face your opponent in bottom position with at least one of your legs between you and him as a barrier. There is of course, a second bottom position that gets a lot less attention due to the fact that it offers a lot less attacking potential and has a high risk of back exposure - turtle position - where you are in bottom position facing away from your opponent on your knees. Though it is not the preferred bottom position in Jiu jitsu it is nonetheless very important due to the fact that it commonly occurs in competitive guard passing and takedown scrambles when opponents are reluctant to concede points. As such it is crucial for your development that you build a strong set of attacks and controls to breakdown the defensive structure of the turtle position. Just as you should be able to pass an opponents guard, you should also be able to break down an opponents turtle position if you are to have a complete top game. Remember that a guard pass score three points - but a turtle breakdown that ends with you in rear mount scores four points and results in you being in the single best finishing position in the sport - so it‚Äôs actually the preferred situation for the top player if you get a choice. Here, talented back attack juggernaut Nick Rodriguez looks to initially control a turtle position with the intention of breaking it down to score with hooks and finish with his powerful rear strangles
"
"Nothing beats the back: in a game where talented opponents can finish you in a heartbeat with strangles out of front head and guillotine positions or sprawl so heavily on top of you that wish you‚Äôd never shot on them in the first place, there‚Äôs a lot to be said to first getting behind an opponent and taking him down from dominant chest to back positions where you don‚Äôt have to worry about those strangles and sprawls. At the top levels takedowns are never EASY per se, but they certainly be EASIER, and that‚Äôs all you ask for.  Keep your eye open for the opportunity to get behind opponents at all times in standing position and you‚Äôll find the subsequent takedowns are generally a lot less stressful.
"
"In the midst of all defense are the seeds of offense: It‚Äôs natural when an opponent attacks you to focus only on saving yourself. Early in your development that‚Äôs the best thing to do, but at some point you have to see ANY TIME AN OPPONENT ATTACKS YOU HE MUST MAKE COMPROMISES WITH HIS DEFENSIVE INTEGRITY, HIS BALANCE, HIS STANCE AND HIS FOCUS. This means that an astute player will see his opponents offense as a fine entry into his own offense. This kind of counter offense has significant advantages over conventional offense since it is performed against an opponent who is compromised physically by being over extended and mentally by being focused on attack rather than his defense. It can be difficult initially to make this mental shift. You will need to clearly identify points at which the attack has been neutralized and a turning point achieved where you can initiate your counter attack. I suggest you start this project with you current favorite submission since you have greater expertise here. Ask yourself what criteria would make it fail and make you abandon it. Then have an opponent attack you with it. Work to satisfy those criteria and as soon as you‚Äôve done so - counterattack! Once you‚Äôre comfortable with you favorite submissions, start expanding the project into others. Soon you will have an arsenal of counter attacks that will greatly increase the number of submission attempts you make per match

"There are many virtues that will help your progress in Jiu jitsu and indeed, in life. Courage, intelligence, creativity etc are all good traits to have that will help you towards your goals - but there is one virtue that stands above all others - PERSISTENCE. In particular, ADAPTIVE persistence. It doesn‚Äôt help to be persistent if you‚Äôre heading in the wrong direction - that‚Äôll just take you further and further away from your goal. You must be persistent while heading in the correct direction. But how do you know you‚Äôre going in the right directions? By observing the results of your work and retaining the work that repeatedly lead to successful outcomes and rejecting or modifying the work that repeatedly lead to unsuccessful outcomes. In time you will adapt your practices in the face of evidence towards success and if you‚Äôre persistent with this, good outcomes are inevitable in the long run. Cultivate within yourself the virtue of adaptive persistence and let time work its magic to make you better at what is important to you, whether jiu jitsu or something else.
"
"Defense into offense: The moves of Jiu jitsu are divided evenly into offense and defense. A perfect defensive game would make you undefeatable. A perfect offensive game would make you capable of defeating anyone. As a general rule it‚Äôs best to begin your study with a bias towards defense, since the most common scenario for anyone starting out in the sport is to be overwhelmed by their more knowledgeable and experienced classmates. Somewhere along the road of your development however, you must begin to synthesize defense and offense. THE COMPLETION OF ALMOST EVERY DEFENSIVE MOVE IN JIU JITSU IS RICH IN ATTACKING OPPORTUNITY FOR THOSE WHO LOOK FOR IT. Here I have stopped an initial leg tackle down on the mat - the second the initial danger has passed it‚Äôs time to switch gears from defense into offense. There are great positional opportunities here - go behinds to the back will always be foremost among them - and also submission opportunities - anything out of front head lock will be a great choice, but there are many others as well. Next time you‚Äôve successfully stopped an opponent with your defense - don‚Äôt be satisfied with stopping them - go immediately into counter offense. You will soon find that opponents are much easier to attack due to being somewhat out of position after their failed attack and you can make the synthesis of defense and offense work strongly in your favor

"Victory in Dallas!! Team New Wave had a great day at the big ADCC Dallas Open yesterday. The event had well over a thousand competitors from all over the nation and once again showed the impressive work @mojassim80 is doing building a grass roots competition league that enables athletes to compete under the ADCC rule set in preparation for ADCC trials and the Olympics of grappling - ADCC itself. There were many outstanding athletes and many outstanding performances. Our team was able to show the fruits of their hard training in preparation taking four gold medals and many other medals and winning the Adult Team Award with a score almost double the next highest team . Current ADCC champion @giancarlobodoni Giancarlo Bodoni surprised everyone by signing up last minute and took gold with a masterful display both standing and on the ground. @tazagarami Oliver Taza had a truly impressive day. He was in the most stacked division of the event which featured many outstanding athletes who‚Äôd been to ADCC or medaled at trials. Not only did he win gold - he did so with a submission rate of almost 85% - a truly impressive performance in the most competitive division of the event! @helenajiujitsugirl Helena Crevar showcased here devastating submission arsenal once again in both teenage and adult divisions - winning double gold with a submission rate over 90%! South African brother and sister @hxnnah_jade Hannah Griffith and @luke_griffithjj Luke Griffith took three gold medals between the family. Hannah won her weight division with a great display of positional prowess. Luke won double gold with a crushingly dominant 100% submission rate performance in two divisions in a very memorable performance, showcasing his impressive technical development and powerful submission arsenal. It was great seeing so many competitors and supporters at the event - perhaps most impressive of all was the depth of talent on display. There were many cases of unknown athletes defeating prominent athletes proving that there are many emerging talents in this fast growing sport!
"
"Attrition: Technical skills are the main basis of victory, but never underestimate the value of TACTICAL considerations in determining victor and loser. It‚Äôs not just about skill level. In a surprising number of instances the more skilled athlete may lose to the less skilled. If your tactics are superior you can reliably make the other guy work harder than you so that while you are TIRED he is EXHAUSTED. Build your skills, they will be your main weapons, but never forget that a weapon is only as effective as the user who employs it - only when skills are employed in line with sound tactics will they be decisive in determining the outcome of a match.
"
"Physical pressure: Submission is the aim of our sport. There are two paths to submission. The first is through mechanical and tactical expertise in execution of the the move. This method is usually the one scene when the submission is performed early in the match when both both athletes are fresh. The second path is through unrelenting pressure that undermines the opponents ability to defend a submission that under normal circumstances they definitely would be capable of defending but in a state of exhaustion they cannot. This is the kind of method usually seen late in a match. Both paths are vital for you to master. As the skill level of your opponents rises however, you will inevitably find that it is the second path that you employ more often and with better results. Physical pressure will gradually degrade an opponents skill level due to the simple fact that skills require physical energy to execute, and when energy levels fall below a certain threshold, even well trained athletes can no longer perform them well enough to be effective. Learning to create and maintain physical pressure over time to a point where you can degrade an opponents skill level to a level where they are no longer effective in executing techniques is one of your biggest long term goals in jiu jitsu. At the higher levels it‚Äôs not how good your technique is per se that counts; but rather how good that technique is after ten minutes of grueling grappling that will usually determine winner and loser.
"
"Standing position and takedowns: When jiu jitsu athletes begin studying standing skills they typically say ‚ÄúI need to improve my takedowns.‚Äù This is certainly true, but as it stands, rather naive. You will need to learn a lot more than takedowns. In fact, takedowns will be one of the last things you‚Äôll be learning. In order to be effective at all with your takedowns, you need a set of supporting skills that make those takedowns possible. If you lack those skills, you can train takedowns all you want and it‚Äôs very unlikely they‚Äôll succeed against a skilled opponent. Everything begins with stance and motion. Then it progresses to contact and grip, and culminates in the ability to off balance an opponent, move him where you want him to move and break his stance. Only when you can reliably perform this on an opponent will you be able to enter into takedowns with a good chance of success. The stance of jiu jitsu is rather different from wrestling and judo. The matches are much longer, so the extreme crouch of wrestling is usually replaced by a more upright stance as deep crouches are fatiguing over a possible 20-40 match. The extreme upright stance of judo is a little too upright in a sport where leg tackles are the main form of takedown, so jiu jitsu typically finds a stance between those two extremes. This early battle for stance is one of the true keys to the standing game. Your goal is always to maintain your stance whilst breaking his. If you can do this first, the takedowns will be a much easier second.
"
"Position AND submission? Usually we think of positional skills as distinct from submission skills in Jiu jitsu - position comes BEFORE submission after all. However, many of the main submissions blend positional pins with submission. The Japanese are often very wise in the naming of their moves. Their term for the most common form of arm bar is juji gatame. ‚ÄúJuji‚Äù means ‚Äúcross‚Äù since the two athletes are generally perpendicular to each other; and importantly ‚Äúgatame‚Äù has a dual meaning of ‚Äúpin‚Äù and ‚Äúlock.‚Äù The idea is that the arm bar has the properties of both a pin AND a submission - that the two cannot be separated. You can immobilize someone with an arm bar as you do with a side of mounted pin; only you use biomechanics like advantage through your legs pinning his head rather than body weight. When you practice your submissions, especially the juji gatame arm bar, really focus on the idea of restraining and pinning an opponent first rather than rushing to the joint lock - you will find that emphasizing the dual nature of submission holds makes them far more effective against tough opponents
"
"Learning together: Jiu jitsu is PERFORMED as an individual but it is PRACTICED as a group. This has deep consequences for all of us. One of the more obvious effects of group learning is that subjectively you never really feel like you‚Äôre getting much better as time passes. That is because everyone else in the room is progressing at roughly the same pace as yourself and learning the same techniques and tactics. The result is that that you can spend months and even years feeling like you‚Äôve worked long and hard but are no better than before. You must have faith that progress is being made even if it‚Äôs not very apparent among your peers. Occasionally you will be given a clear sign of your progress. It usually comes in the form of a training partner you don‚Äôt often spar with. One who previously used to dominate you and who perhaps has been training less - not so little that his skills have simply degenerated, but enough that he has been static in his progress. You spar and for the first time you do very well against him. Signs like this signal your hard won progress and let you know that the hard work has paid off. If you feel at times like it‚Äôs like swimming upstream with hard labor but no progress, be assured that the very nature of group training in a dojo makes it seem this way, but that if the training program is well designed and you are putting the work in consistently, you ARE making progress. It won‚Äôt be obvious in most cases, just as you can be driving fast on the highway but feel you‚Äôre not just because everyone else is driving fast alongside you - but everyone so often you‚Äôll see signs of that progress - be proud of it - you‚Äôve earned it
"
"Maximum effort: Making progress in Jiu jitsu is no easy feat. There are a thousand obstacles that you will run into daily, weekly, monthly and yearly. There will be days you swear you‚Äôre getting worse rather than better, times when you feel everyone is progressing faster than you, moves that seem to work well on you but which you can‚Äôt seem to perform on anyone. Understand that maximum effort is not just about how hard you can push your body - it‚Äôs about how long you can push your mind. As long as the mind leads - the body will follow. No matter how tired your body may be if you can keep your mind active you will never stop. Keep your mind in the game by constantly setting new goals, asking yourself what you can change to improve progress and studying the great athletes of past and present and researching how their knowledge can translate into your progress. Physical exhaustion is normal and, within common sense limits, a good thing in so far as it indicates the kind of effort required for excellence - it will pass with a good meal and a sound nights sleep - but mental exhaustion is fatal as the body won‚Äôt follow a despondent, unmotivated mind. Look for ways to stay mentally engaged and motivated and physical fatigue will never stop you.
"
"First negate - then attack: Some of the most exhausting and frustrating sessions we have are those where you go against an evenly matched opponent and you both relentlessly attack each other move for move. This is certainly exciting and fun, but often does not get us the kind of replicable results we are looking for. ATTACKING WHILE BEING ATTACKED is not really the ideal - it‚Äôs not wrong and it can work on occasion, but in the majority of cases you will better exemplify the spirit of Jiu Jitsu - control leading to submission - by first NEGATING YOUR OPPONENTS ABILITY TO ATTACK YOU and only then ATTACKING YOUR OPPONENT. When you have first shut down the other fellows offense - you can focus much better own your own offense. Here, Nicky Rod first gets defensively sound limb positioning and stance inside the dangerous guard of Keenan Cornelius so that he can shut down the immediate danger and then can better focus on his own offensive passing game

"The story of Rory MacDonald and his walkout music: One of the most distinctive elements of professional fighting is the fighter walkout. Often they are moments of high drama and suspense. One of their central features is music. Fighters select a song that embodies their spirit and attitude as they go out to do battle. Rory MacDonald grew up listening to Slayer and Scorpion, by the time I started working with him as he trained next to Georges St Pierre his preferred listening material was crazy death metal that could scare a grizzly bear away. It was always something of a mystery to me then, that when he would go out to fight his music would be some really low powered garbage that just sounded awful. Finally he told me the story why. A long time ago he lost his phone. That phone number was the one kept by the UFC staff responsible for fighter walkout music selection. Some random guy found the phone and started using it. The UFC texted him, thinking it was Rory, and asked what walkout music he wanted. The random guy gave a song recommendation. We will never know if this random guy either had a genuine sense of humor or whether he just had awful taste in music. Either way, it ensured Rory went out on multiple occasions to hilariously bad songs üòÇüòÇ It culminated one night were Rory went out in Philadelphia where his opponent came out to The Rocky Theme, which of course got the Philadelphia crowd absolutely amped up! Then Rory came out to MC Hammer Can‚Äôt Touch This üòÇüòÇüòÇ The look of dumbfounded horror on Rory‚Äôs face was priceless as he went out to a song he never wanted and the crowd reaction was total LOL Wut? This was the straw that broke the camels back and Rory finally got his groove back by making sure his music got selected properly üòÇüòÇ If you were the guy who found the phone - how far would you have gone with the music selection? For sure I would have requested It‚Äôs Raining Men üòÇüòÇüòÇ That would have been enough to ruin any fighters career üòÇüòÇüòÇ On my drive home home tonight for sure I‚Äôm going to drop some MC Hammer in honor of that unknown comedian - break out the baggy pants and let‚Äôs go! üòÇüòÇ

"Congratulations to Gordon Ryan and Giancarlo Bodoni! These two incredible grapplers just won @flograppling Best Male Athlete 2022 (Gordon Ryan) and Breakthrough Grappler 2022 (Giancarlo Bodoni) awards! It was an incredible year for both men in ways that were both very different and similar. Both relocated to Austin Texas as part of a broken team. Both were regarded as unlikely candidates for a great 2022. Mr Ryan was reconciling himself with the notion of retirement due to a severe stomach problem and had fallen away from competition and even training was very difficult and frequently interrupted. Mr Bodoni was coming of seven consecutive losses in relatively minor league local no gi competition. Their diligence and perseverance allowed them to claw their way back into the game - small steps in the gym followed by smaller competitions. Mr Ryan began with exhibition matches and Mr Bodoni started with local competitions against unknowns. Both put in huge amounts of work and made changes to their game that kept them progressing forward. In the biggest show in grappling history - ADCC 2022 - both shone like stars. All that unseen hard work put them in a mindset where they could not be beaten. Watching that progression from such an unpromising start to such a dazzling conclusion in such a short timeframe will be forever one of the most impressive displays of training commitment I saw in my career. Congratulations to both of you! No one deserves it more!!

"Pins are a means not an end: A very distinctive feature of my students approach to Jiu jitsu is to never be happy with an upper body pin. We get taught to value guard passing and pinning so much - indeed, the point system rewards you and enables you to win matches with pins alone - that it‚Äôs easy to skip over the extra step of finishing from a pin. Good Jiu jitsu always sees a pin as a means to the end of submission holds. That means you must go behind the act of pinning chest to chest and into the more difficult world of LIMB ISOLATION AND CONTROL. Only an isolated limb can be submitted. Learning to draw a limb away from the torso and into a finishing hold can be a frustrating experience. Limbs by their very nature are more difficult and intricate to control than torsos and now you need to explore the more complex world of levers and fulcrums. You must push yourself past pins and into submissions if you are to satisfy the ideal of Jiu jitsu. Here, Gordon Ryan leaves the security of chest to chest immobilization and isolates an opponents arm as a precursor to submission holds - with a grip like this he has quite a selection of potential finishes to work with here - which would you choose if you were in his place?
"
"Two mindsets in Jiu jitsu: When it comes to attacking an opponent there are two mindsets. The first is to decide what form of attack you want to use and impose that upon your opponent. This methodology is all about knowing your own strengths. You know what you‚Äôre good at - impose those skills upon the opponent regardless of what he is doing and be so good at them that he can‚Äôt stop you even if he knows your intentions. The second is to observe your opponents stance and movement and harmonize your choice of attack with whatever opportunity his stance and motion offers. This methodology is all about knowing what attack is appropriate for a given opportunity. The first is a matter of building a small set of highly developed and unstoppable attacks. The second is about building a large set of attacks that only need to be good enough to break through a momentary weakness. Both approaches are highly effective. In my experience the unstoppable attack method is best in shorter matches where there is a discrepancy in skill or size in your favor. The opportunistic attack method does better in longer matches where skill and size is more even - however this is a generalization and there are notable exceptions to this. Over time most athletes gravitate naturally more towards one than the other but most great athletes can play both approaches even though they generally favor one over the other. I generally find the opportunistic method has a smoother and more refined look to it and as I have aged and grown weaker I have favored it more - it generally requires a less physical game. Essentially it is a choice between the ability to amass great strength to smash through very strong defenses vs the ability to see a weakness and quickly attack with adequate strength to break through in the time available. Try to develop both but it‚Äôs natural that you will probably favor one over the other
"
"It ain‚Äôt over till it‚Äôs over: A common tendency among developing athletes when working from guard positions is to initiate a nice sweep that topples the opponent, but then to let the opponent recover by neglecting to come up quickly into top position and secure the completion. Remember, you don‚Äôt score by knocking the opponent down, you score by going from bottom position to top position. That means you must develop the habit of getting up after the initial knockdown and grappling for top position. Don‚Äôt sit there congratulating yourself just because you knocked the other fellow to his butt - that‚Äôs not enough to score - go through to completion by rapidly getting up and over your opponent so that there is a clear reversal of top and bottom position. Only then do you actually score. Make a mental habit of pulling yourself up and forward after every knockdown and you‚Äôll soon be scoring far more often than previously
"
"Old friends: One of my favorite things is seeing old friends again. Chris Weidman was one of the most talented MMA athletes I ever worked with. He came to train with me when his first jiu jitsu coach (and my great mentor) Matt Serra suggested he come in to work with me in the blue basement. Chris had the goal of beating the man many believed at that time was the MMA goat - Anderson Silva. It seemed an impossible goal. Mr Silva was literally toying with his opponents at this time. Mr Weidman was an exceptional student who learned moves with ease and moved like a welterweight despite being a big middleweight. The first time we worked together was the Tom Lawler fight which Mr Weidman won in seconds with a devastating Darce strangle. Then he defeated Demian Maia and Mark Munoz, endured a terrible shoulder injury and surgery and then began one of the most impressive fight camps I ever saw to get ready for the challenge of his life against the great Anderson Silva. He went on the shock the world by convincingly winning two fights against Mr Silva. After that we drifted apart and worked together only once more - for his thrilling match against Kelvin Gastulem, where once again Chris Weidman showed his grappling skill - winning with a beautiful kata gatame strangle. He came into Austin today to work on his grappling! It was like old times! He did a fine job studying some of the recent changes in submission grappling and showed that brilliance of his that I saw so many times years ago in the basement!
"
"Resistance: Everything you do in this sport - you will be doing against resistance. Your opponents know what you want to do and they generally know the counters to whatever you are attempting - SO EVERYTHING YOU DO IN THIS SPORT MUST BE DONE IN THE EXPECTATION OF BEING STOPPED ON THE FIRST MOVE. As such you must program yourself to THINK AHEAD TO THE NEXT MOVE and very possibly the third and fourth move. Don‚Äôt leave it to the moment and try to figure out a continuation in the heat of battle - HAVE THE NEXT MOVES PLANNED OUT IN ADVANCE based on previous experience. This is how you win in a game where everyone knows all the major moves and counters. Victory will go to the athlete who executes the best and who works around resistance best.
"
"Push and pull: We don‚Äôt believe in super powers - you don‚Äôt have to - the power that good mechanical understanding and efficiency can give you is more than enough for anything you need to do in Jiu jitsu. The greatest power in Jiu jitsu is the ability to successfully utilize the potential of action and reaction. When you can elicit a push from an opponent and then pull him in the same direction as his push - you will use his own strength to off balance him. LEARNING TO EXPLOIT THE INCREDIBLE POTENTIAL OF ACTION/REACTION IS THE GREATEST STEP YOU CAN MAKE IN JIU JITSU. This is the best means of defeating faster, stronger and more athletic opponents. The key to learning is to engage in push and pull at every opportunity during drilling and sparring and so develop a sensitivity to where your opponents energy is being directed at any given moment. When you push, feel his push back, and PULL. When you pull him, feel his pull back and PUSH. This sounds simple, but making a habit of it in a hard sparring match takes time and awareness. What is simple in concept is not so simple in operation. Start small. In drilling out hands on an opponent and start pushing and pulling each other with only moderate force and low speed until you develop an ability to read his energy level and direction and then give a little push when pulled or pull when pushed - try to use the least force  you can to get the biggest reaction you can. You can use this EVERYWHERE - standing, ground, top or bottom. It is a foundational principle in most martial arts - make it the foundation of your game and you will add a level of depth and skill that will make you stand out among your peers
"
"Countdown in Texas: The squad is in Austin Texas getting ready for the big WHO‚ÄôS NUMBER ONE grappling show tomorrow night. Gordon Ryan will take on one the squads biggest rivals, Vagner Rocha. Both athletes have met before but in a lighter weight category and both have changed a lot since their last meeting. Nicky Rod is back on stage. He will take on the great ADCC champion Yuri Simoes. Mr Simoes is one of only three athletes ever to win ADCC gold in two different weight categories. Both have a high energy takedown focus game and neither likes to give an inch of ground - this one should be a great match! Oliver Taza will take on Johnny Tama in another exciting match up. Today was weigh in with all athletes close to each other in weight to make for a great show tomorrow! Now it‚Äôs training time and then tomorrow the big show!!
"
"Jiu jitsu super stars vs Team Khabib! There is a fascinating grappling competition coming up this weekend in Kazakstan at the @aiga.global grappling show. Teams from Dagestan and China will face off against an elite Jiu jitsu team chosen by ADCC head @mojassim80 His choice of athletes is very impressive! The team features Giancarlo Bodoni and Luke Griffith from New Wave, Izaak Michell, Dante Leon, Cole Abate, Fabricio Andrey, Gabriel Sousa, Zach Kaina and John Hansen! It‚Äôs an extraordinary team with tremendous talent in every aspect of Jiu Jitsu and coming from very different gyms with different styles but working as a team against the very impressive Eastern European grappling styles! Match formats are unusual - three five minute rounds where athletes have to win a majority of rounds to win or submission at any time wins outright. Being In Kazakstan it‚Äôs being contested at altitude so endurance will be a big part of it! The rules are an interesting blend of ADCC and IBJJF scoring which will benefit the wrestling heavy Eastern European style. This should be very interesting! I like the idea of a Jiu jitsu super team with very different backgrounds coming together in a far off location and a unique rule set against very tough opposition. The event will be shown on @flograppling and should be a great show!
"
"Continuity: One of the great features of most elite Jiu jitsu players games is continuity. It seems that no matter where the action goes - standing, ground, top or bottom - there is no discernible break in their game - they just flow from scenario to scenario without pause. This is crucial to success as it ensures that they can maintain pressure against an opponent for the full duration of a match without interruption. If you have an opponent who knows they can relieve pressure by taking you into a position or scenario where you have noticeably less skill, he will definitely take the match there whenever he needs to take a break from the action and get some active rest. When you have continuity in your game across all the major scenarios this isn‚Äôt possible. You don‚Äôt need a vast array of moves to exhibit competence across the whole spectrum of scenarios in Jiu jitsu. Initially just a few high percentage moves will get you good results. Start mapping out the areas of your game where you have very limited skills and filling them in until you start to feel continuity across the whole game - you‚Äôll soon feel the benefits in matches!
"
"HAPPY NEW YEAR FROM THE SQUAD!! Wishing you all the best for 2021!! Thank you all for your interest in the incredible work of my students and our philosophy of Jiu jitsu. We hope to show much more of our work around the Jiu jitsu world in the coming year - hopefully fate proves kinder to Jiu Jitsu this year than last, but whatever happens, dedication and determination will always prevail over hard times - wishing you all a great night and an even better year!
"
"Luke Griffith victorious in Poland! Outstanding South African jiu jitsu student Luke Griffith punched his ticket to the biggest show in grappling today at the European ADCC trials in Poland. Luke won the under 99kg division with a 100% submission rate - incredible for such a high level tournament. He has trained so diligently over the last year and despite ups and downs with injuries he came through today in outstanding style and guarantee his place in Las Vegas ADCC IN 2024. Daniel Manasoiu and Oliver Taza both won silver in their divisions and will go the next trials with a lot of confidence given the strength of their performances and the high submission/dominance they showed prior to finals. Congratulations Luke - it‚Äôs great also to see African jiu jitsu getting stronger and the growing internationalization of the sport!
"
"Loneliness in a crowded room: Jiu jitsu is at the same time both a deeply personal and a very group oriented journey. You train and develop in a group - but you experience everything, every small daily triumph and failure, as an individual. In truth there will be many more failures than there will be triumphs. It‚Äôs natural to feel that everyone else is stronger, faster and more talented than you. That everyone else learns and progresses faster than you do. Don‚Äôt get too caught up in comparisons with those around you. Focus more on comparisons with earlier renditions of yourself. As long as you continue to improve a little at a time you will get to the level you want. You will get there faster than some  and slower than others. It does not really matter WHEN you get there so much as it matters THAT you get there. It‚Äôs good to be ambitious and want to get to goals quickly and efficiently but temper this sentiment with a healthy dose of reality. If everyone else in the room is progressing at roughly the same rate as you then you will never suddenly feel as though the game suddenly became easy. Remember also that the only common characteristic that everyone who got to a high level in the sport exhibited as PERSISTENCE. When it gets lonely and disheartening take a step back and reflect on the virtue of persistence. Understand that everyone else who entered that room felt the same way many many times. Most quit and so never realized their potential in this domain. The few that didn‚Äôt are the one who are so good they make you feel as you do know. Stay in the game. The feeling of frustration that is so strong in you today can be replaced by elation tomorrow with just one small and unexpected success.
"
"Use your hands to take away their ability to post their hands and form a base of support - then let your legs provide the horsepower that sweeps them over. Good sweeping action from bottom position usually requires all four of your limbs working in unison. You‚Äôll need your hands to prevent him posting to the floor. Then you‚Äôll need your feet lifting him so that his stomach begins to face up to the ceiling. If you can get that interaction between your hands and feet going well, you‚Äôll give your training partners some air time!
"
"The mount as a grappling pin: The mounted position is the most desired position in classical Jiu jitsu. This is because classical Jiu jitsu is FIGHTING Jiu jitsu. The mount is the best pin for striking an opponent with fists and elbows - given that Jiu jitsu Beas originally conceived as a fighting art of self defense this made perfect sense. But what about modern sport Jiu jitsu that does not allow strikes of any kind? Should the mount still be held in highest regard among the pins? Of all the frontal/ chest to chest pins I still believe the answer is yes. This is because not only is the mount best for striking, it is also the best for smothering pressure that disrupts breathing. The mount aligns your torso with an opponents and as such creates great opportunities for smothering pressure - far more so than side or north south pins or knee on stomach. As such even in a pure grappling match, the mount should always be a goal once you pass an opponents guard. The kind of pressure the mount can generate creates reactions in your opponents that facilitate submission holds. Learn to use the mount for what it is - an intimidating, smothering pin that can break the defensive discipline of even the toughest opponents in ways that open them up more readily for the true goal of Jiu jitsu - submission
"
"Distance: Control of distance is a crucial concept in all combat sports and jiu jitsu is no exception. There will be times where you can make effective grips on an opponent, but they cannot make effective grips on you. These are the moments when you want to make distance work in your favor. Maintain a distance where you can make effective grips but your opponent can‚Äôt and you‚Äôll have a handy initial advantage that will create momentum in your favor at the onset of an engagement. While that certainly doesn‚Äôt guarantee a win, if you can do this consistently you‚Äôll stack the odd well in your favor, and in this game, that‚Äôs the best we can ever do.

"Counting down: We had a great workout at UFC Apex center tonight in Las Vegas in preparation for Thursday night UFC Grappling Invitational. @nicholasmeregali @jiujitsugiant @helenajiujitsugirl  were joined by Gordon Ryan who is starting a long road back to health now. We were joined by the prodigious wrestling talent @romanbravoyoung who is also competing and my great friend and student @bzglick Mr Young used to train with us sporadically back in the blue basement so it was a pleasure to see him again. With him came UFC legend @dominickcruz - watching those two workout was something special! Tomorrow is weigh in day and then the big show Thursday evening!
"
"The ultimate submission: We all have our favorite submission holds - in time I hope you develop at least five to six submissions that you can attack from anywhere on anyone - but never lose sight of a fundamental truth in grappling - the ultimate submission is not a hold per se - it is FATIGUE. If you can PHYSICALLY AND MENTALLY BREAK an opponent with fatigue he will submit with his MIND first and then with his BODY second. A big part of your skill set has to be the skill of WEARING DOWN AND EXHAUSTING AN OPPONENT SO THAT ALL THE SUBMISSION HOLDS ARE EASY TO APPLY AND TO WHICH AN OPPONENT WILL GLADLY SURRENDER. There are ways to control and manipulate grips, stance and pace that are heavily in your favor so that an opponent is working at two or three times the rate you are. If you can maintain this the result is inevitable - an opponent who is looking for an excuse to quit - your submission hold provides that excuse. When you put hands on an opponent your constant underlying goal should be to create a disparity in work rate skewed in your favor that opens the door to submission later in the match.
"
"Focus is everything in this game. Mentally, focus yourself on the next step on the chain to victory - physically, focus a greater percentage of your strength upon a lesser percentage of an opponents strength at a vulnerable point of his body and you will break him

"Modern Jiu jitsu lost one of its true characters today - ‚ÄúBig Gord‚Äù father of Gordon Ryan and Nicky Ryan passed away in his sleep last night. Mr Ryan Sr was a stalwart supporter of his two sons Gordon and Nicky from the earliest days of their commitment to Jiu jitsu. He would come to many of their training sessions, almost all of their matches from white belt to world championships. He had unshakable confidence in the abilities of his sons and stood by them unfailingly through thick and thin, wins and losses. There is a sense in which Big Gord was a metaphor for the squad itself, he didn‚Äôt always say the polite or correct thing, was rough around the edges and unconventional in his approach, but underneath it all he had a heart of gold and stood by his friends and judged everyone by their merits. He was one of the unexpected stars of the 2019 ADCC World Championships as he strode from mat to mat to proudly watch his sons take center stage. He was a real character at these events. Normally the squad is known for their very analytical coaching style - Big Gord came from the opposite direction with his surprisingly insightful psychological pre match advice and humorous call outs that had us all laughing and smiling between and after matches. In the end, that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs all about - showing love and support for those around you and creating warm smiles and memories for your family and friends. Thank you Gordon, Nicky, Trish and Nathalia for helping Big Gord through this health issues these last few years - i know it was often a difficult and lonely task - you all showed  exceptional generosity and kindness to your dear father on a level the world will never know. Wishing you all strength and recovery.
"
"The remarkable power of underhooks in ground grappling: It‚Äôs never enough to just pin someone with body weight in Jiu jitsu. To exert meaningful control you need to go further and anchor yourself to your opponents body in ways that 
- shut down his ability to escape
- set up submission holds
- facilitate moving to another pin 
Probably the single best best thing you can do to achieve these things is to underhook your opponents arm. This immediately anchors you to your opponent in ways that make escape difficult and control easy. This should be one of the first things you look to attain once you get to half guard top or any pin except north/south. Don‚Äôt settle for just pinning - get your underhook as soon as possible and you‚Äôll double your effectiveness from top position
"
"Finishing grip first or control grip first? There are some submission holds that involve a certain grip associated with the submission, for example a rear naked strangle involves a strangle hand around the neck, a heel hook a wrist under the heel. Without that grip the submission would never occur. In addition they require a control grip. In the case of a rear strangle it‚Äôs usually the rear mount itself with you legs as hooks locking you in place, in the case of the heel hook it‚Äôs whatever ashi garami variation you‚Äôve chosen. The question is - which comes first? In the majority of cases the control grip ought to to come first. It will slow an opponent down and give you the ability to focus on getting your finishing grip in place. In this photo you can see Garry Tonon has established ashi garami control first to lock on to an opponents hips and now he can fight to get his wrist to the heel. At the higher levels however, there are good reasons to sometimes switch the order - usually because opponents have highly developed defensive skills. Sometimes slipping the strangle hand in first and then beginning a strangle to distract an opponent will allow you to then slide into rear mount uncontested. Similarly with a heel hook. Exposing the heel and getting your wrist to the heel first and then sliding into your favorite ashi garami will sometimes allow you to bypass the whole hand fighting phase of leg locking and grant you faster, cleaner finishes. Understand that usually the conventional method of control first, submission second is the way to go, but let let that blind you to other possibilities when circumstances change
"
"The heavier your opponents chest becomes - the lighter his legs become: Jiu jitsu is a game of weight distribution. Sometimes it can very intimidating to feel an opponent putting all his weight on to one part of your body. Remember however, that the more an opponent uses his weight to crush one part of you, the more he must lighten some other part of his body. If you remember this you can use this to your advantage. Here, my training partner has committed weight into chest to chest pressure - that‚Äôs a good thing as long as he has stepped over over one of my knees, but an elbow escape allows me to recover my guard and now that heavy chest to chest pressure that was so useful and beneficial a moment ago is now a liability. With all the weight being applied at the chest, the legs have become light and easily flipped over by my legs. Next time your suffering under weight distribution - be confident that the heavier the distribution in one area - THE LIGHTER IN ANOTHER - and navigate a course to take advantage of that the light zone (hint: it‚Äôs almost always some form of elbow escape or bridge escape) and turn a hard time into a success
"
"Everything is easier when you get behind opponents: Whenever you feel you need a simple sense of direction in the middle of a tough match - it can be staged in three simple words - GET BEHIND HIM. Everything gets easier when you‚Äôre behind an opponent rather than battling him face to face. Opportunities to get behind are everywhere - standing, ground, top or bottom - they are always there. Make sure you have a set of trusted methods of getting behind from all the major scenarios and you‚Äôll never lack a sense of direction on the mats!
"
"Getting ready: Every gym workout is future focused. Your goal is not to win today but to tomorrow, not to be perfect now, but to edge closer to a perfect tomorrow. When you take this mindset you‚Äôll take the risks you need to take in the gym so that in the future you‚Äôll be confident enough to use them without hesitation on stage; you‚Äôll experiment with new moves and tactics that can broaden your future repertoire. How you do today is inconsequential compared with how a future you does in a much more important setting

"Conversation: I had the great pleasure of a conversational podcast with Lex Fridman and my two great students Georges St Pierre and Gordon Ryan. Mr Fridman went through some great questions on sports performance and greatness and Mr Ryan and Mr St Pierre have some brilliant replies. We chatted for over three hours on everything from Jiu jitsu to mma to animal combat to alien life üòÇüòÇ It was a truly great honor me to work with these two kings of their respective sports for so many years and it was a joy to reflect on it all in conversation with Lex. The podcast should be released pretty soon - hope you all enjoy it!!

"When you‚Äôve got a choice‚Ä¶Very often the scenario we find ourselves in presents a choice in finishing options. A classic example is triangle and arm bar. WHENEVER YOU HAVE ONE OF THESE OPTIONS - YOU ALMOST ALWAYS HAVE THE OTHER AS WELL. As a general rule - I always urge my students to take the triangle option over the arm bar option all other things being equal. Of course there will be exceptions to this general rule. For example, if your opponents has very broad shoulders and you have short legs, it‚Äôs probably best to stick with the arm bar option. However, the triangle offers the option of both strangle and multiple joint locks at the same time - all backed up by a much tighter control of the head than an arm bar due to the figure four lock. The arm bar on the other hand offers only a single joint lock and much looser head control. So given the choice, triangle will be my preference. Next time your attacking arm bars and the finish isn‚Äôt coming quickly - perhaps try a switch to a triangle and see if you can use some of the inherent advantages to help your cause

"Victory in Florida! Nicholas Meregali @nicholasmeregali won double gold today in Orlando at the annual IBJJF Pan Ams event. It was one of the most dominant displays of gi Jiu jitsu since the legendary Roger Gracie performances of 2009-10. He won every match by submission from mount or rear mount save the final of open class which he won by sweeping, passing and mounting his very talented rival. It is incredible to think he did this with less than three weeks preparation after focusing primarily on no gi Jiu jitsu for the last year. His jiu jitsu skills and charisma are unmatched on the gi competition circuit and he showed this weekend that he is continuing to improve. Well done Nicholas Meregali - that was one of the most impressive displays of championship Jiu jitsu I ever saw!
"
"Getting the band back together: Hanging out with old partners in crime Rory MacDonald and Firas Zahabi at the PFL weigh in in Dallas Texas. Mr MacDonald successfully made 170 pounds for his bout tomorrow night against the very tough Brett Cooper. It‚Äôs been awesome talking about old times and getting ready for new ones. Now it‚Äôs time to recharge and strategize with the best in the business!
"
"Two for the price of one - the dual power of leg locks from bottom position: When an opponent is in your guard his legs are his base of support. If you attack his upper body with submission holds he still initially has his legs under him giving him a stable base from which to defend himself. When you attack the legs with submission holds something interesting happens. Now you are attacking two things at once - his leg as a submission target and his base of support. It is so much harder to defend a lock when you are unstable. This usually forces the opponent to change his posture to sitting or kneeling to gain a new stable posture from which to defend his legs - and this immediately renders him vulnerable to follow up positional attacks. By attacking the legs you create an automatic double attack and a follow on attack that is extremely difficult to deal with when done well and which keeps an opponent on the defensive. Make sure you can threaten your opponents legs from bottom position - you‚Äôll get twice the bang for the buck
"
"The power of kimura: Of all the major submission holds, kimura is in my experience the one which creates the most devastating injuries when opponents fight to the end and refuse to tap. All the major submissions are capable of doing serious damage when taken to their conclusion but the extreme rotation power of kimura creates total separation of the joint that often results in gruesome dislocations and on occasion, even spiral fractures of the bones. It is a move that is often disparaged as a strong mans move, but this is an unfair criticism. If you let an opponent lock his hands in front of his torso and fight his two hands with yours - then yes - strength will be the deciding factor. However, if you get an opponents hand behind his back or use your legs to supply the rotation power against his hands, smaller athletes can definitely use this move against bigger athletes. Understand always that there are many variations of kimura - many of which incorporate the legs and thus avoid the two versus two hands deadlock and use legs against hands to ensure skill, not strength will be the deciding factor. Here, Gordon Ryan works on expanding his formidable submission repertoire with kimura practice. Note how he immediately gets the hand behind the back to take strength out of the equation and take advantage of the devastating rotational power of the move.
"
"Victory in LA!! Nicholas Meregali was able to fulfill his dream of winning the IBJJF Open Weight division today in Long Beach, California. It was a remarkable weekend for the Brazilian jiu jitsu star. He won every match until the finals by submission with his scintillating display. He did all this while suffering from a severe rib injury that occurred thirteen days before the tournament and which got progressively worse with every match as the weekend unfolded. Mr Meregali showed real courage and mental fortitude to take the final in a gritty and hard fought match and take gold. It was a real lesson in the degree to watch inner resolve will always play a powerful role in the outcome of championship matches - mechanics and tactics are responsible for most victories- but the most memorable ones are often those that have more human elements at their core - Mr Meregali showed that this weekend.  It was a fantastic event overall with so many great athletes present and many outstanding matches - I hope you all enjoyed the show!

"Closed Guard: When most people think of guard position in Jiu jitsu, the first image that comes to mind is closed guard. That‚Äôs probably because it is usually the first form of guard that most people are taught. It is probably the oldest,
most traditional form of guard. With the plethora of new types of guard coming out over recent years many ask whether closed guard is still relevant, especially with the rapidly developing no gi game. The answer, I believe, is an unequivocal YES. Closed guard will always be relevant no matter what other advances are made in jiu jitsu bottom because of the very same unchanging principles and concepts that made it the first major choice of guard generations ago. Closed guard is unique in so far as it positions the most important part of your body your HIPS, above your opponents hips - even though you are in bottom position OVERALL, your hips are in top position. This has immediate consequences. It means that, unlike any other guard, if you sweep an opponent you will finish mounted, rather than merely top position in front of an opponents guard. If at any time you get past your opponents elbow, you will be rear mounted. In addition, unlike any other form of guard, closed guard creates a tactical asymmetry in so far as your opponent cannot realistically attack you as long as your guard is closed, but you can attack him at will. Another important difference with regards closed guard is that unlike any open guard, it enables you to control DISTANCE between you and your opponent. The lock of your feet enables you to hold him within your guard and thus the distance between you and him is determined by you. In open guard your opponent controls distance and therefore chooses the time and place of engagement. These fundamental facts about closed guard make it a position that every jiu jitsu athlete has to take seriously in their development. Oftentimes I hear people say that their body type is too short or stocky to use closed guard. I have has numerous students whose body type seemed unpromising for closed guard but who nonetheless used it very effectively. Good tactics can almost always find a way around apparent physical limitations.
"
"Angle: Mount and closed guard are essentially inversions of each other (as far as positioning goes). As such, they have something important in common - they require a pivot of ninety degrees if you want to attack your opponent with arm bars. This perpendicular shift is the key to strong arm bar attacks from mount and closed guard. The main obstacle to this perpendicular shift is almost always your opponents ELBOWS. It interesting how when we set a goal in Jiu jitsu, say an arm bar from guard, it turns out the most important precursor has nothing or little to do with the goal - but if that innocuous precursor isn‚Äôt satisfied - the goal will never be reached. The only way to turn ninety degrees against a resisting opponent is get the elbow of the arm you wish to attack inside your hip. You have many favorite moves I am sure - be sure to clearly identify exactly what the essential precursors to all those moves are, so that you have a clear sense of what you have to accomplish before your favorite moves can work. This step by step approach is vital to your success and progress.
"
"Climbing the rope: When you go to climb a rope you don‚Äôt just magically spring up to the top of the rope - you get your grips and climb step by step to your goal at the top. So too, in grappling. You generally start at the extremities of the body - the hands or head if you are standing or bottom position and the feet if you are in top position, and then you climb progressively to the center of the body, gaining ever increasing control as you get closer to the hips, spine and head. Don‚Äôt start at the destination. Start at the extremities and climb your way there.
"
"With regards technique - fashions come and go - what is popular today can be replaced by tomorrow - but underneath that surface technique lies something permanent, something deep and unchanging whose weight will give your game gravitas - the bedrock of the art - PRINCIPLES.

When we begin Jiu jitsu our question is always ‚Äúwhat move do I have to do to get out of this predicament?‚Äù As we grow in skill the new question becomes, ‚Äúwhat move should I do to attack?‚Äù As you go further still the question you must constantly ask yourself is ‚Äúwhat move comes next if this one should fail.‚Äù The reality of beginner Jiu jitsu is that is most about escaping bad situations. Intermediate Jiu jitsu is most about learning skills to with which to attack. Advanced Jiu jitsu is mostly about the exchange of attack and counter against a highly skilled opponent who knows all the same moves you do and also how to defend them. As such, the great skill you need is not attack per se, but combinations and chains of attack working on the assumption that the first ones will usually fail and it will be the second, third or fourth that gets the breakthrough. Even when everything is locked in and the end seems assured - your mind should STILL be asking - WHAT‚ÄôS NEXT IF THIS FAILS? Here, Georges St Pierre‚Äôs triangle track looks final, but his arm position will make entry into leg locks easy and automatic should it fail nonetheless. This is the spirit you want to aim for. Remember always that as a general rule in Jiu jitsu defense is easier than offense, so your offense must carry a greater degree of precision and persistence than a potential opponent counts on.

"When you control the head and shoulders - you control everything: When it‚Äôs time to control an opponents movement - and that should be the goal of all us - nothing beats chest to chest or chest to back contact when your past you‚Äôre opponents knees and in control of the head and shoulders. If you can get to a position like that on an opponent your own size and skill level, you‚Äôll win that position in the great majority of cases. Get used to parking your head right next to your opponents with at least one arm under his arm and you‚Äôll have him in a bind that he will find very difficult to get out of and very difficult to counter whatever you choose to do. Next time you want to put some heat on a tough opponent either get behind him or over one of his knees and get head to head with an arm under his and you‚Äôll definitely have him under pressure!!
"
"If you can get an opponent off the ground with controlling grips - you own him: In order to initiate any kind of meaningful action an opponent must have contact with the mat - if you take that away from from him he can‚Äôt do anything until he returns to the ground. One of the very best ways to render an opponent momentarily helpless is to lift off the mat - how they land is up to you. There are many ways to do it - make sure you have at least one that you can perform very well - it‚Äôs an incredible weapon to have in your arsenal

"I am very pleased to announce the release today of my latest instructional video NEW WAVE CLOSED GUARD: BUILDING A COMPLETE CLOSED GUARD SYSTEM. In it I show all the most important and high percentage attacks without the Gi in the modern game. The emphasis is on showing how the unusual amount of distance control, hip control and off balances from closed guard allow a much more systematized approach than the more chaotic open guard scenarios. This allows a step by step procedure attacking an opponent on their knees or standing with a very aggressive array of upper body into lower body submissions mixed with positional attacks. In addition I cover how shorter, stockier athletes can use tactics to make closed guard work effectively for them. Closed guard will always be a foundation of jiu jitsu and with good reason - no other bottom position offers the same degree of overall initial control over an opponents movement and balance. If you want to make it part of your no gi game, take a look! Link in my Instagram bio

"Breaking a turtle down versus riding: When it‚Äôs time to attack an opponents turtle position, I general counsel students to begin by breaking an opponent down to a hip. This immediately reduces their athletic potential  and makes them much more controllable so that you can focus on applying your attacks. However, there are going to be times you cannot do this on tough opponents. Then you will have to get hooks in and ride the opponents turtle while they are still on their knees. You can see Nicky Ryan doing a fine job of this here. Be sure to maintain a tight chest to back connection at control both sides of the body - otherwise you can slip off and end up underneath your opponent. Interestingly, the more your opponent resists being off balanced and broken down to a hip, the more he will have to widen his base and open himself up to your hooks and riding. The more he tightens up to resist the insertion of your hooks and riding, the easier he will be to off balance and break down to a hip - so the two modes of attacking turtle work very well as a dilemma.
"
"When the work is done: One of the clearest signs that you have a sustainable training environment is the clarity of the division between work time and playtime in the training. When it‚Äôs go time everyone has to be all in. No bullshit, all focus - you‚Äôre there to be the best athlete you can.  But when it‚Äôs done there has to be some clown time to make it an enjoyable part of your day. If it‚Äôs all seriousness and suffering even the most disciplined people will eventual tire of it and find another way to live. If it‚Äôs all spring break then nothing gets done. Finding the right compromise between beneficial suffering and delayed gratification versus happiness and play is the key to longevity in the sport. We take a stance of hard work time but very relaxed playtime afterwards with lots of poking fun at each other and off limits humor - the best antidote to the biggest problem of long term development - burnout. Everyone has their own correct balance - somewhere you have to find yours
"
"Control: The fundamental goal of good Jiu jitsu is always control that leads to submission. A good indicator of the degree of control you have is HOW MUCH SPEED AND EXPLOSIVE STRENGTH DO YOU HAVE TO USE IN ORDER TO SUCCESSFULLY APPLY YOUR SUBMISSION HOLDS. As a general rule, if you can only get opponents to tap by exploding into submissions at maximum speed and strength, you are not really controlling your opponent and you are using speed as a substitute for control. This will inevitably lead to a high failure rate and many injured training partners. When you can use submission holds to RESTRAIN MOVEMENT and apply them in SLOW MOTION with the same devastating effects as at maximum speed and power - then you know you are on the path to mastering CONTROL. Here, Gordon Ryan a young master of control, shows his ability to lock down even the most powerful and explosive opponents as he immobilizes the great champion Matheus Diniz and slowly and safely applies his heel hook submission even under the great stress of championship grappling. Make CONTROL your ideal and you can choose how you apply your submission holds and run the full range of gentle to devastating applications depending upon your circumstances

"In the gym you regret every minute of playing defense - it‚Äôs uncomfortable, frustrating and unexciting. When the chips are down however, and you‚Äôre in the battle of your life against a very dangerous opponent, you will relish the memory of every minute you spent working defense and wish only that you‚Äôd spent even more time in those uncomfortable, frustrating and unexciting positions. Don‚Äôt skimp on defense - you only learn it‚Äôs value when you really need - and by then it‚Äôs too late. Know it‚Äôs value early on and you will have a real advantage over your peers
"
"Don‚Äôt be satisfied: When you stop an opponents move in its tracks it‚Äôs always a good feeling, but don‚Äôt be satisfied with good when great is right around the corner. As soon as you stopped an opponent‚Äôs move, switch your mindset from defense to offense and take advantage of the fact that whenever a move fails your opponents posture will almost always be compromised. This make your offense much easier. So program yourself to attack in that window of opportunity. When you stop your opponent - don‚Äôt stop yourself - this is the time to move immediately into your own attack!
"
"Adaptations: It‚Äôs been fascinating watching the adaptation from gi to no gi for Nicholas Meregali. Things are still in early stages but his progress has been dramatic. Much of this progress can be attributed to Mr Meregali himself - he already had world champion skill level before he entered the door and in addition he has shown himself to be very professional and dedicated with his daily training schedule. In my experience the top Brazilians always bring a special quality of movement that is quite unique to their Jiu jitsu culture - a great flair for hip movement in bottom positions and misdirectional movement on top and a great propensity to find and maintain the back in a scramble - almost all the best Brazilians shine in these areas and none more so than Mr Meregali. Adding to this the more structured, step by step systematic approach we favor has been fascinating to observe. The results in the gym have been very impressive so far - still a big journey ahead but a journey is always more fun when the start is strong üòúüòú I‚Äôm excited to watch this great athlete step out on stage March 25 in his first no gi match at @flograppling Who‚Äôs Number One event!

"The power of upper body takedowns: The most commonly applied and scored takedowns in no gi grappling are lower body takedowns - tackles to the legs - usually single leg and double leg variations. While there is no doubting the effectiveness of these techniques, they do have some issues in the context of no gi grappling. First, the contact they make is chest to thigh. This means that upon contact with the ground you lack upper body control. This always creates scramble conditions that make scoring under Jiu Jitsu rules very problematic against a skilled and experienced opponent. Second, the lowered head and arm positions create dangerous amounts of head exposure (guillotine) arm exposure ( kimura/Darce/armbar) and back exposure (sprawl and go behind). It is very prudent to add upper body takedowns that begin with chest to chest or chest to back contact that greatly reduce the dangers of prolonged scrambles and submissions as you attempt takedowns. In the no gi context these typically require a blend of wrestling, judo and jiu jitsu skills adapted to Jiu jitsu scoring criteria. It is a fascinating part of the game and one that Jiu jitsu must incorporate if it is to progress towards it‚Äôs potential in takedowns suited to its unique rule set. You will often see my students utilize upper body takedowns when possible due to the advantages I mentioned. Best of all is to blend both upper body and lower body takedowns to create a dual threat that opponents will find very difficult to contend with. Most Jiu Jitsu students have a solid understanding of upper body grips from their guard game - once they learn some principles of positional advantage in standing position they can usually adapt fairly quickly to gain competence on their feet with those same grips. My students where able to showcase upper body takedowns to medals at ADCC 2022 - with training they can work for you too!

"Thailand: We are counting down to the big @onechampionship event here in Thailand. It will be fought in legendary Lumpinee Stadium Bangkok, one of the great homes of Muay Thai and the headline bout will feature one of my absolute favorite current Muay Thai fighters, the outstanding Superlek Kiatmuu9, truly one of the technically proficient and exciting strikers in the world today. As such, all the bouts, including the MMA bouts will be fought in a ring rather than a cage. While I believe that a cage is much better suited to the nature of MMA fighting than a ring, it‚Äôs very much understandable why in Lumpinee they went with traditional ring, especially when a boxer of Superlek‚Äôs stature is the main event in front of Thai audience. A ring brings some unpredictable chaos into MMA bouts when you get close to the ropes and corners, this can be good and bad. Undeniably some of the greatest MMA bouts of all time have been fought in rings - think of all the classic Pride matches - so this will be a very interesting show for this alone. Most of all, it‚Äôs an honor to be part of a show in Lumpinee, which stands in the history of Muay Thai as Madison Square Garden does in the history of boxing. Now it‚Äôs back to training at the local Muay Thai gym and their ring!

"Triangles - Making two good choices into one great choice: Among the submission holds in Jiu  jitsu there is a basic choice between strangles and joint locks - both are great options. In the vast majority of cases it‚Äôs an either/or choice; the triangle however, is one of the few options that allows you to attack both at the same time. It is a superb strangle in its own right, match the impressive power of your legs against an opponents neck. However, it also traps, isolates and immobilizes the opponents arm in ways that allow for easy juji gatame armbar attacks, ude gatame arm bar attacks (reverse arm bar), kimura attacks and wrist locks. Defending one of these is not easy. Defending two at the same time of far harder. Defending two at the same used in combination with the others is damn near impossible. Take advantage of the unique properties of the triangle to improve your submission percentages next time you‚Äôre on the mats!

"I am happy to announce the release of my latest instructional video from the NEW WAVE JIU JITSU OPEN GUARD:SWEEPS AND REVERSALS today. It features our approach to open guard play. The pressure of lower body submissions creates reactions that feed into our sweeps and reversals game. No matter what an opponent does - drops to knees, backs away, tries to crowd you or defensively hand fights - there is an answer to will get you top position. This is the no gi open guard play you see my students use so successfully in competition. Any attempt to stop leads right back into lower body submissions, creating a dilemma that is very difficult to overcome! If you want to build a devastating no gi open guard game, check this out!

"New Wave Half Guard: I am very pleased to announce the release today of my latest instructional video NEW WAVE JIU JITSU: NO GI HALF GUARD: THREE DIRECTIONS OF ATTACK. I put a very heavy emphasis on half guard training. In fact I believe that many athletes half guard makes more sense as a primary bottom position game than most of the more traditional bottom positions. Over the years I have noticed a general trend whereby many students get faster positive results in bottom position from half guard than they do from more standard variations of guard positions. This is particularly true of older students or those who are less flexible, slower, shorter limbed - many of these students struggle with classic variations of guard but quickly find a natural home in half guard and make faster progress there. In addition, half guard offers great potential for extremely effective distance control and so applies extremely well to MMA and self defense applications where striking is involved. Another great advantage of half guard is the ease with which it integrates into the scramble game as part of failed takedowns and sweeps and the ensuing scrambles - it often gives those with a weaker takedown game a second chance at gaining top position after an initial failure. Perhaps the most important aspect for beginning students is that half guard integrates so well with escapes. In live sparring escapes are often easy to initiate but difficult to complete. Half guard gives you the ability to take even a minimal start with an escape and build it into a half guard from where you can fully reverse or submit even very tough opponents. If half guard is a skill set that sounds like it may help your game and your progress - check it out! Link in my Instagram bio

"Counting down in Austin, Texas: Nicky Ryan and Ethan Crelinsten will take on exceptionally tough opponents tomorrow night at the WNO Grappling show on @flograppling Mr Ryan will take on the very formidable PJ Barch who combines a D1 Wrestling pedigree with black belt Jiu jitsu to form a very dangerous hybrid game matched with his impressive physicality. Mr Barch has a been a very tough rival for the squad for a long time with standout performances in the classic EBI shows when the squad began! Ethan Crelinsten will rematch the brilliant ATOS prodigy Cade Ruatolo who forms one half of the powerful Ruatolo brothers - they have also been powerful adversaries of the squad with wins for both sides. They have a brilliant and dynamic game with tremendous endurance and a cracking pace. Everyone has weighed in successfully and now just light workout tonight and all action tomorrow night! Hope you enjoy the show!

"You can never go wrong in Jiu jitsu is you focus on getting mounted or rear mounted. There‚Äôs a thousand different directions you can go at any given time in a match - some are good, some aren‚Äôt - but two directions that are always good regardless of context are mount and rear mount. So if your stumped for direction - just focus on those two and you can never go wrong.

"If you can present and frame the problem you‚Äôre trying to overcome in a clear and well defined way - the chances of a good solution go up dramatically. If you seek solutions - start with a clear articulation of the problem!
"
"The best all round method of passing guard - pass from half guard: There are many effective ways to pass an opponents guard, but to me, the single best all round method will always be to pass from half guard. Why? Because the vast majority of guard passes end with head control as their final step. This creates a critical weakness within them - the need to transition from control of the hips/torso to the head. Making that transition - the cranial shift - always presents a window of opportunity for a talented opponent to escape back to guard as you attempt to make that final transition. The beauty of half guard passing is that unlike other passing methods, you can control the head BEFORE you pass. This removes the vulnerable cranial shift from the process and makes for total control from beginning to end with no real weak points. Of course you need to know other methods, but make sure you put a heavy emphasis on developing your half guard passing game - no other method is so tactically sound
"
"Open guard - so many possibilities - don‚Äôt restrict yourself: So many people start their open guard play with the idea that as the guard player, they have to stay on the back or buttocks until they get a sweep or submission. This is absolutely not the case. You will never maximize your potential in bottom position open guard until you get comfortable with the idea of getting up from your back or buttocks and coming up into reversals. This is even more so when training no gi. In live sparring against someone your own size and skill level it is very difficult to sweep cleanly or submit decisively. Most attempts fail. It is crucial that you be able to follow a failed sweep or submission with a reversal where you scrimmage up from bottom and come to your knees and/or feet and finish by taking your opponent down and taking top position. The same is true in situations where you have an opponent who stays out of range of your primary guard attacks. You need to threaten coming up from bottom into takedowns to cover distance and force the pace from bottom position. In response your opponent will have to stuff the takedowns - this gives you the perfect opportunity to gain the connection you need for more conventional guard sweeps and submissions. In this way you can create a dynamic and attacking open guard game that can threaten opponents at every range and where you control engagement from bottom position. Remember, just because you START on you back or buttocks doesn‚Äôt mean you have to STAY there. Play with a wider array of body postures and you‚Äôll be rewarded with a wider array of attacks across a wider array of scenarios
"
"When it all seems confusing‚Ä¶There are many times when the moves of Jiu jitsu seem damn confusing and difficult to perform even in basic drilling with a cooperative partner - forget about live sparring. Whenever this occurs remember this - every move is a sequence of component moves each requiring mechanical details in order to be effectively applied. For any given move, certain stages in that sequence and certain mechanical details are more important to the overall success and failure than the others. If it ever seems too confusing and complicated - FOCUS ONLY ON ONE OR TWO MAJOR FEATURES OF THE MOVE RATHER THAN THE WHOLE MOVE. If you can adequately perform two components of a six stage move on Monday, then add another on Wednesday, two more on Friday and the last on Sunday - you can perform the move in a week. Don‚Äôt get discouraged when the whole move doesn‚Äôt come quickly - focus on the components instead. Your goal is to learn the move - no one ever said you have to learn it all first time around. I would be happier seeing a student learn and competently demonstrate the first stage of an elbow escape in a session than make a hackneyed and clumsy rendition of the whole move that would never work in sparring. In a single workout - BETTER TO LEARN A PART OF A MOVE WELL THAN THE WHOLE MOVE POORLY - you can always learn the next steps next time.
"
"If you can make an opponent carry your weight in an inefficient manner for extended periods of time - you will exhaust him to a degree that moves that wouldn‚Äôt have worked on him at the start of the match will start working on him. Of all the weapons you have at your disposal - time is one of the most significant - learn to use it well and your effectiveness on the mat will skyrocket
"
"There is a direct correlation between how long you can stay on the back and the number of strangles you can score on the back: Submissions takes take time. Strangles from the back take even more time than usual. If you can‚Äôt maintain back position for a respectable amount of time it‚Äôs going to be very difficult to reliably finish from there. As such you have to develop your back riding ability as a skill in itself. Only when you can MAINTAIN the back position can you FINISH from the back position. Begin by seeing how long you can stay on a tough training partners back. Try to improve your times with every attempt. Train your eyes to SEE submission opportunities but don‚Äôt act on them until you‚Äôve held the position as long as you aimed to do. Time spent training this way will pay big dividends when you have to go against an opponent with good defensive skills and where the finishes don‚Äôt come easy.

"Hands and feet: when you use your arms to grab something you will usually use your hands as the connection to the object you are grabbing. So if you want to pick up your briefcase - you will use your hand to grip the handle and your arms (in unison with other body parts) to do the lifting - the arms do the heavy work, the hands provide the connection. The legs and feet operate in a similar way from open guard position. In most cases, Your legs do the heavy work, but the feet provide the connection to the opponent. Knowing this, when you are passing open guard, you must be mindful to control your opponents feet as much as possible and seek to prevent them connecting effectively to your body (usually your legs). Foot control is essential to success. If the opponents feet can connect securely to you, he will be able to use his legs very effectively to cause you many problems; but if the feet can‚Äôt make effective connection, it will be more difficult for the legs to play an effective role. So when passing - MONITOR HIS FEET and try to prevent them connecting solidly to your legs. You‚Äôll have a much easier time imposing your passing game when you do so
"
"Committing to your attacks: Sometimes when we attack we do so anticipating failure - this immediately becomes a self fulfilling prophecy. Entering into an attack without sufficient commitment to carry it through to completion is almost always a guarantee of failure. When you go into an attack with the intention of winning with it - go in with the commitment required to win with it. Even if you‚Äôre faking an attack to set up another you‚Äôll need sufficient commitment to creat the APPEARANCE that you‚Äôre going in to win with that move. If mechanical inefficiency is the most common PHYSICAL reason why moves fail in Jiu jitsu, TIMIDITY is the most common PSYCHOLOGICAL reason for failure. Moves applied with excessive timidity are as apt to fail as moves that lack sound mechanics. That doesn‚Äôt mean going crazy in the gym - it just means recognizing what level of force application is required to get the job done and making sure that timidity doesn‚Äôt put you below that force requirement. Make your calculation and go!
"
"The athlete goes out alone: When we think of athletes getting ready for competition in Jiu jitsu we tend to think mostly about the teamwork of preparation, working with your sparring partners, coaches, strength and conditioning trainers etc. This is a relatively small percentage of the average day however. Most of your time you‚Äôll be alone in your house, your car etc. As the time draws near you‚Äôll be surrounded by fans, haters, officials, opponents, but the more people around you the more you‚Äôll feel the reality that when the match starts it‚Äôs you and only you that steps out in to the mat. If there is one attribute you‚Äôll need to stay sane and succeed it is SELF RELIANCE. Cultivate this as an attribute every chance you get. Get comfortable being by yourself and comfortable with yourself, even in a crowded room. When you can be ALONE WITHOUT BEING LONELY you‚Äôll have the inner strength needed for the big show. When you‚Äôre surround by thousands but alone inside yourself and comfortable, you‚Äôre ready to perform on stage. Get comfortable with solitude and you‚Äôll create the success that will make people want to be around you.

"Double trouble: When it comes to joint locks, here is a an axiom that once learned and understood, will make a big difference to your performance. WHENEVER YOU GO TO BREAK A LIMB DURING A COMPETITIVE MATCH, NINETY PERCENT OF THE RESISTANCE WILL COME FROM THE ACTION OF THE OTHER LIMB. This is true for both arm locks and leg locks. If you try to break the left arm, most of the initial resistance will come from the holding action of the right arm. If you go to break the right leg, most of the resistance will begin with the movement, blocking, or locking of the left leg. As such, whenever we get into position to break a limb - WE HAVE TO BE READY TO CONTROL AND SHUT DOWN THE EFFECT OF THE OPPOSITE LIMB. If you can do this you will immediately create twice as much danger to your opponent (double trouble) than if you only focus on the limb you‚Äôre trying to break. Learn to CONTROL an opponent as you move towards the joint lock by controlling BOTH limbs, and then learn to manage the transition to the isolated single limb when it‚Äôs time to BREAK him - if you can do this, you will become a dangerous joint locker indeed. Here, Craig Jones uses the principle of double trouble to tie up an opponent and then brilliantly managed the transition from two legs to one so he can generate the pressure required at championship level against the toughest opponents to get the win. Make the principle of double trouble part of your submission mindset and double your effectiveness
"
"Bottom game is more difficult for most students to learn than top game: When I teach people beginning Jiu jitsu I almost always start them with bottom game first. The first skill they must master is pin escapes, since in their early days they will be fighting out of bad positions for most of their training time. Once they learn to escape to guard from a bad pin, they will need to learn to hold on to their guard so that they don‚Äôt get out but then immediately put right back into the pin they just escaped from - so guard retention is the next skill they need to learn. Then they need to learn to fight effectively from their back as they can now get to and hold a guard - now it‚Äôs time to attack from there. You can see all these first skills involve fighting from your back. Part of the reason this should be taught first is practical - because as a beginner with no takedown or pinning skills you will almost certainly find yourself underneath opponents. In addition it recognizes that if you are matched against bigger opponents you must be able to survive and fight from underneath. The other big reason is that most people find the act of learning to fight from their back more difficult than from on top. Nothing in life prepares you for the movements and techniques of bottom game. I‚Äôve seen plenty of athletic beginners come in and do pretty well in top position on day one - but never seen that from bottom position.  Instinct and natural talent doesn‚Äôt help much from bottom - you have to learn everything. As such the learning process is usually longer in bottom position than top for most people - SO START WITH A HEAVIER EMPHASIS ON BOTTOM GAME FIRST - it will give you more development time. You can always play catch up with top skills later.
"
"Isolating limb: One of the core concepts of Jiu jitsu is that of attacking a vulnerable point of an opponents body with a larger percentage of your physical resources than he can muster with his physical resources. This means isolating a single limb and locking it with a substantial part of your body - preferably the legs and hips. Pinning an opposition good, but what will make you great is the action of going beyond pinning the torso and isolating a limb so that you get to the greatest goal of submission. Constantly look for opportunities to isolate a limb and surround it with your legs and hips - this is the path to ideal Jiu jitsu
"
"If you can isolate a limb, then you can control the limb, and if you can control that limb you can break that limb: Isolate - control - break. This is the pattern of submission grappling. You need to keep your opponents limbs apart from each other - remember that most of an opponents initial defense to a joint lock is to use his other limb to defend the one that is under attack - so isolation is important here. Get used to the idea of taking opponents limb away from the other limb and away from his center of mass and you‚Äôll get the isolation needed to get to your victory
"
"SUBMISSION from mount without the gi is often a very different position from HOLDING the mount: Normally when we aim to hold a tight mount we stay roughly aligned with our opponents centerline with our hips over his hips. However, when it‚Äôs time to enter into mounted arm bars and triangles we have to climb up high to the shoulders and pivot ninety degrees while totally changing our leg placement (often referred to as S mount). This angle and position allows you full use of your hands to pull and manipulate and the legs and hips to wedge your opponent and prevent defensive movement. This requires some balancing on your part, since you have less base under you, but as they say - nothing risked, nothing gained. Here, Gordon Ryan, master of the mounted position goes to work with hands, hips, legs and angle - you know already what the outcome will be
"
"Carry your opponents weight easily through posture: When you work in bottom position you will have to carry your opponents weight on top of you for extended periods. This can be tiring and fruitless if done with poor posture. IF YOU WANT TO EASILY CARRY AND MOVE HEAVY OPPONENTS FROM BOTTOM KEEP YOUR KNEES TO CHEST AND SPINE CURVED LIKE THE BOTTOM OF A ROCKING CHAIR - just as a rocking chair can easily carry and move heavy bodies, so too will you. Look how Nicky Ryan uses the banana curve in his spine to topple an opponent forward and easily move him into a position where he can lift himself into a cross ashi garami entry. If your spine is flat on the floor you will feel every ounce of your opponents weight and won‚Äôt be able to move him an inch. Put a healthy curve in your spine and you will bounce him around from one attack to another.

"Victory in Las Vegas: The UFC ran a great grappling event here in Las Vegas tonight. Gordon Ryan won a tightly contested victory in a dramatic over time against former Team mate Nicky Rod. Mr Ryan showed his attacking prowess in the over time with Mr Rodriguez playing a cagey game to avoid submission and get to over time. In over time both men showed their riding prowess but it was Gordon Ryan who prevailed and won via greater riding time. There was some confusion in the final round as the referee appeared to let the match continue after time had expired as Nicky Rod worked for a stranglehold but the mistake was noted and the win awarded to Gordon Ryan. In the second super fight Dan Manasoiu won via mounted asphyxiation against Ricardo Evangelista. Luke Griffith had a brilliant night, getting to the finals of the absolute tournament after entering on only a days notice. He lost a thriller to Mason Fowler by just a few seconds in triple overtime. Overall a great result for the team. It‚Äôs great to see grappling on @ufcfightpass and great to see the youngsters getting closer to their goals! Hope you all enjoyed the show!!

"If you can get around an arm - you‚Äôre in control: Every time you start to engage you‚Äôre in front of your opponents arms - if you can slip around or over them - there is nothing between you and your opponents back - and that‚Äôs always the best place to be! See your opponents arms for they are - the major barrier between you and your opponents back. If you can cultivate the art of beating the arms - it won‚Äôt be king until you‚Äôre beating opponents!

"Victory in Sau Paulo! Nicholas Meregali returned to Brazil to compete in the Brazilian National Championships and won in characteristic brilliant style! He showed his impressive attacking game that makes him the most exciting gi athlete on the planet, winning with his dynamic strangles. In the finals he took on the great Brazilian athlete Fellipe Andrew, one of the very best in the business, and attacked with a dizzying array of sweeps from his powerful open guard, then shocked everyone with a very well executed uchi mata throw in standing position and straight into a beautiful strangle to win! It was a real pleasure observing some of his training preparation here in Texas and then seeing him apply it so well in one the toughest gi tournaments of them all. Well done, Nicholas! And a lesson to all athletes that winning is great but best of all is to win in a way that conveys the central theme of all good jiu jitsu - constant and exciting attacks directed towards control that leads to submission. Winning makes an athlete respected - but winning like this makes you a legend!
"
"Fighting your way out of trouble: If there is one certainty in Jiu jitsu it‚Äôs that your opponent will create every bit of havoc and trouble for you that they can. The typical pattern will always be one of you constantly having to dig yourself out of trouble and then get back on the attack. When we drill we typically just practice moves assuming we are in control of the action, but the reality is that in sparring and competition we are rarely in control of the action. Usually it‚Äôs a back and forth battle where you‚Äôre defending against your opponents attack with you working hard to shut it down and then trying to establish your own attack. This pattern is maintained until one of you fatigues or one of you can establish a position or move that exceed the others ability to defend. Get used to this sense of back of forth struggle. It‚Äôs exhausting and frustrating but it‚Äôs the essential nature of the game. If you can‚Äôt accept and embrace that, then you cannot expect to do well

"The pattern of champions: In Jiu jitsu and in life, some individuals seem to rise to a level above their peers. It‚Äôs worth asking if there are any patterns that emerge in this process that perhaps we could emulate in order to improve our own performance in whatever field we wish to progress. There are many factors that I have observed over the years but let‚Äôs focus on one for today. Jiu jitsu offers an ocean of moves - far more than you could learn in one lifetime. Our lives are short and our minds limited in capacity. So what are we to do? We are caught in a conundrum. There are ten thousand moves in Jiu jitsu. Any one of those moves could be used by an opponent to defeat us. Yet we can‚Äôt hope to learn them all in depth as it would take ten lifetimes to do so. The way champions respond to this problem can be stated in a single sentence. To excel in your field - YOU NEED TO LEARN A LITTLE ABOUT A LOT AND A LOT ABOUT A LITTLE. Yes it‚Äôs true that there are far more moves than you can ever learn - SO FOCUS ON A SMALL NUMBER OF MOVES THAT ARE HIGH PERCENTAGE AND FIT WELL WITH YOUR BODY TYPE AND PERSONALITY AND YOUR VISION OF WHAT YOU WANT TO EXPRESS - so learn a LOT about a little number of crucial moves that form your core skill set - they will be responsible for the vast majority of your wins and success. Yes it‚Äôs true that any one of the thousands of moves of the sport could be used by an opponent to defeat you - so learn a LITTLE about all of them - just enough so that you have awareness of the danger. As long as you can perceive danger ahead of time you can defend a move with minimal knowledge by disengaging early - ignorance of encroaching danger has gotten more people submitted than all other factors. This is how champions get around THE PROBLEM OF KNOWLEDGE. They learn a lot about a little and seek MASTERY in a small set of skills that make them powerful; and, they learn a little about many moves, just enough to perceive danger early and move away before it‚Äôs too late. In this world it‚Äôs impossible to know everything - AND YOU DON‚ÄôT NEED TO - you just have to know everything about a few things and a little about the rest.
"
"Why stay in front of opponents when you can get behind them: To a large degree Jiu jitsu is the skill of maneuvering behind opponents. Sure, you can finish people from frontal positions, but nothing will match the relative ease and certainty of getting behind people and working from there. Try to make this PROGRESSION TO THE BACK an IMMEDIATE REFLEX in your part. Opportunities don‚Äôt last long in competitive matches so the earlier you make your move the better in most cases. Just as you wouldn‚Äôt accept being in front of an opponents legs when playing against an opponents guard, but rather always seeking to get around his legs to the side, so to from turtle position always seek to get past your opponents arms and get to the back. Of course there will be times when you may favor frontal attacks such as Guillotines or other strangles from the front, but your default option should always be to go behind your opponent
"
"Be quick to critique your own moves as you perform them. Develop a clear sense of when they will work and when they will not. When you feel them begin to fail you will be able to read failure quickly and move to a second move more quickly than an opponent can follow with his defense and get a breakthrough. At the higher levels it‚Äôs often not who moves first fastest that wins but rather who moves second fastest.
"
"Isolation: Whenever you go to attack an opponents arm or leg, the vast majority of his immediate defense will always come from the OTHER arm or leg. Therefore you must become adept at isolating your opponents hand from his other hand, or his foot from his other foot so that they cannot support each other. Learning to interfere with the other arm or leg so that it can‚Äôt be used for defensive purposes is a big part of effective arm locking and leg locking. Don‚Äôt get tunnel vision on the arm you‚Äôre attacking - pay attention to the other arm or leg as well and you will be much more successful with your arm and leg locks

"Chasing dreams in Austin: Oliver Taza @tazagarami and Helena Crevar @helenajiujitsugirl along with Davis Asare @davis_asare led the New Wave team to a great night of local Jiu jitsu here in Austin. Oliver and Helena won title belts at the @enigmajiujitsuofficial Enigma Grappling show. Many of the juniors competed tonight and gained the valuable experience needed to go from small to great over time. It‚Äôs always great to watch them go out and apply what they train so hard to do every day in the gym! Congratulations everyone - back at it again tomorrow!

"Friends and mentors: Mentors can have a powerful influence on your development in Jiu jitsu. One of my most important mentors when I began Jiu jitsu was IBJJF world jiu jitsu champion, ADCC champion and UFC champion - the inestimable Matt Serra @mattserrabjj He was a dynamo in the gym - one of the very few Americans of that era who could prove a real match for the best in the world. He inspired me and everyone else in that room to get better. Last night he and old friends Din Thomas and John Rallo stopped by for dinner. Matt is in town to do the Joe Rogan @joerogan podcast! Let me tell you something - Joe Rogan is a very talented and well trained comedian, but Matt Serra is the best natural comedian I ever met in my life! Between the two of them this is going to be an instant classic of humor and jiu jitsu! I can‚Äôt wait to see this one! Anyway, it was great seeing my old buddies from the pre-basement days once again! Thank you always Matt for being such a good jiu jitsu influence on all of us and taking everyone‚Äôs expectations for what they could achieve to a higher level.

"One of the single biggest differences between BEGINNER and EXPERT in Jiu jitsu is that experts employ their HEAD while grappling and physical means of pushing, blocking, trapping their opponents to a MUCH greater degree than most beginners. Most beginners have a natural tendency to shy away from head contact and often look away from opponents or hang back with their head for fear of hurting themselves or training partner. This is something you have to get over. You head is one of your most effective mechanical tools in grappling. Use it whenever you can. Here I use head position combined with an underhook to block a training partners ability to move his own head and thus facilitate a half guard pass. This is just one of numerous ways you can use your head to gain advantage or defend yourself in grappling. Start experimenting with head position as a means to increase the effectiveness of your favorite positional moves or as a way to stop your opponent performing his moves - you will soon find there are many effective ways to do so!

"I am very sad to see that the great Robson Gracie Snr, father of my teacher, Renzo Gracie, has passed away. Years ago Mr Robson Gracie would periodically come up to New York to see his son and stop by the blue basement. When he came we were all expecting a fire breathing dragon given the nature of his sons! We were completely wrong. Mr Robson Gracie Snr was a remarkably gentle and quiet soul. When he came into the room he was an observer who watched, studied and gave encouraging advice from his vast experience. One day after class he spoke to us through his son Renzo and gave an insight that I never forgot. He said that the true intent of the martial arts was not to make the strong stronger, but to make the weak sufficiently strong that they can stand up to anyone and walk with dignity and confidence in a rough and tumble world. It was a beautiful statement from a martial arts master who had overseen generations of the best combat athletes. He saw the early days of his art, made great contributions to its advancement, raised icons of a new generation of Jiu Jitsu representatives and saw Jiu Jitsu‚Äôs expansion from a local family art to an international sport with a global following. Stay strong Renzo and family üáßüá∑üáßüá∑üáßüá∑

"Purpose: The single most important thing you carry into your daily workout is not your skill, your knowledge or your desire or most of the things mentioned in this regard - ITS A SENSE OF PURPOSE. Know what you want to work on and achieve in every session and you will soon find that progress becomes the norm rather than the exception. Time spent just rolling around sparring is fun and it‚Äôs fine to do that periodically or on light days, but it does very little to MAKE YOU BETTER THAN YOU WERE BEFORE THE WORKOUT. Going in to a workout KNOWING WHAT YOU ARE TRYING TO ACHIEVE AND HAVING A SIMPLE PLAN TO DO SO makes all the difference. When the workout is over, you will have a sense of improvement and a sense of what you you need to do tomorrow. If you can stack up many such workouts over time - you can achieve things that once seemed impossible
"
"Inside control and outside control: All physical control over another human being is based on the idea of grip. When it comes to gripping an opponent you have two main choices. The first is to grip inside your opponents limbs with your limbs. This is allows you to separate his limbs away from his torso and often makes it difficult for the opponent to get a solid controlling grip on you. The second is  grip his limbs from the outside. This allows you to push arms and legs across the centerline and expose an opponents back and gives a great ability to clinch around an opponent in beneficial ways. Both are superb methods when used well and both can be countered when used poorly. EXCELLENCE IN JIU JITSU WILL REQUIRE YOU TO BECOME HIGHLY PROFICIENT IN BOTH. You can have a preference - that‚Äôs fine - but you can‚Äôt simply ignore one in favor of the other. There are so many ways to use both to advance your game and win that it would be a great disservice to yourself to only focus on one. Here, Nicky Ryan does some work from closed guard - an excellent example of controlling the opponents body from outside and around with the legs. If he wanted - he could play a hybrid game with outside control with lower body and with inside control at the upper body; or, play outside control with both arms and legs - it‚Äôs up to you - but make sure you learn to use both to maximize your development!
"
"Being told two dozen details about a given move will not prove as useful to you under the pressure of sparring or competition as the three most important details ranked in order of importance. Better to remember a few items of the most important information than forget two dozen items from a forgettable and unranked list. Remember this always when both teaching and learning
"
"Taking the power out of your opponents side pins - getting under hooks: It‚Äôs never any fun getting pinned by a good top player. Not only is it hard to move - sometimes it‚Äôs hard even to breath - and a skilled opponent is constantly threatening to convert the pin into a submission hold. You can take way much of the power of your opponents side pins by consistently pommelling your arms under and inside his into under hooks. This greatly undermines his connection to your torso and allows you turn onto your side rather than flat on your back. This immediately takes pressure off the diaphragm and helps you breath more easily. It also allows much easier movement towards guard position and/or getting up to your knees to escape the pin. In addition it greatly reduces the immediate danger of most of the standard submissions from this position. It doesn‚Äôt take much to get that under hook in, but the rewards are great. Next time you‚Äôre suffering under a smothering side pin, rather than just try to bulldoze your way out, work to get both your arms under his first. Then get on to your side and you‚Äôll find that everything from breathing  to movement to escapes become significantly easier and less risky.
"
"The only human super power - legs and hips: We humans are generally rather feeble creatures in comparison with the other mammals, but one thing we‚Äôve got going for us when it comes to generating physical force is our hips. The rotation of your hips can create real force, add to this the strength and endurance of your legs and even the feeblest can generate a surprising amount of force. As raw beginners, Instinct makes us grapple with our hands and arms, but training will change this and make you grapple with your feet, legs and hips - a far superior methodology. The earlier you make the switch from predominantly upper body to predominantly lower body grappling, the faster you‚Äôll progress. There aren‚Äôt many things you can truly trust in life, but your feet, legs and hips are three things that you can put all your grappling faith in
"
"Every attack from bottom is first an attack on your opponents stance and balance: There are a thousand ways to attack from bottom position in Jiu Jitsu, but they are have a common start. Your opponent can only withstand your attacks and go on to pass your guard when he establishes good posture and balance. It‚Äôs stands to reason then, that every time you go to attack from bottom position your first target should be his posture and balance - regardless of what attack you‚Äôve chosen. When you can snap an opponents hand down to the floor, knock his butt back to the mat, get his head lower than his hips and all those other signs of successful breaking of balance and posture, then you will suddenly find whatever attacks you favor are suddenly working much better. In a world of huge numbers of possible alternatives - LOOK FOR THE SMALL NUMBER OF COMMONALITIES THAT THEY ALL SHARE - focus your attention on those essential commonalities and watch as all those myriad possibilities become realistic probabilities.
"
"How much are you using your head when you grapple? Usually when we say ‚Äúuse your head‚Äù we mean you ought to use your brain more - but in grappling it very often is used literally. The head is one of the most effective tools you have in grappling, particularly when you hands are preoccupied (which is almost always the case). The must important function of the head is as a pushing implement - though it can other functions as well. Whenever you hands are busy and you need to push, block or trap a part of an opponents body - USE YOUR HEAD. It will often mean the difference between a move working or failing. Look how Gordon Ryan uses his head to flatten and align an opponent as his hands are preoccupied by a bodylock pass grip. Keep a straight spine to minimize neck strain as you do it - you will be delighted at how often and how effectively you can use your head to supplement the pushing, blocking and wedging of your arms.

"5:30am another night done: Here is an old photo taken at the end of a long night working nightclub security back in the 1990‚Äôs. Like most bouncers I worked at a few clubs that provided steady gigs for a period of time, along with numerous others where I would do freelance work replacing someone who couldn‚Äôt make it, got hurt or recently left. You can tell this was at one of the more action packed venues by the short hair (always better for fighting) and football jersey (excellent for fighting - totally rip proof, bare forearms to facilitate strangles and prevent people gripping sleeve cuffs and interfering with strikes, easy to wash out booze and blood), ultra baggy pants with robust leather belt for mobility while staying firmly in place and preventing someone pulling your shirt over your head in a melee and blinding you - low riding pants are never a good idea in a full out brawl - it‚Äôs hard enough to fight other people without having to fight your own pants at the same time! Next to me is a tall bar stool - if a fight went to knives I would immediately smash the stool into the floor and now it provides two long and strong sticks - an excellent improvised counter to knives which saved me on several notable occasions. I‚Äôm waiting for the promoter of the event to finish counting his cash - he used to make a lot it from his cut of Mo√´t champagne sales at the bar. As such he was an obvious mark leaving the club with the money - I would escort him to his ride back to Brownsville Brooklyn and then I was done - I would walk home and spoil myself with a big old cheeseburger with lettuce and tomatoes at a local 24 hour diner - sometimes the patrons of the club that I had been fighting earlier in the night would also be there and usually it would be straightened out but sometimes we would fight again üòÇ Then I would get some sleep and get ready to go and teach Philosophy at Columbia University- sometimes with cuts, bruises or black eyes from the night before üòÇ Crazy times in my early days in America, but it was these early experiences that created my first interest and experience of Jiu jitsu and had a huge impact on how I perceived the value of the art.
"
"Stacking the odds in your favor: Jiu jitsu is never easy, any time your engaged against someone your own size and skill level every match will be a tough trial. Nonetheless there are some things you can do to make things a little easier.  You can see here that from bottom position I have focused on. First, distance control. I have applied an ashi garami that puts a knee in front of my opponent to prevent him easily moving forward and a knee behind him to prevent him easily moving backwards. In addition I have knocked his hands to the floor. This immediately means he is carrying most of his own weight on his hands. If he is carrying his own weight, then I don‚Äôt have to. As such my work load has decreased significantly. In addition his lower body becomes lighter as he carried weight on his hands making leg submissions easier to enter into. Perhaps most importantly, if his hands are on the floor then they aren‚Äôt on me - as such it will be very difficult for an opponent to engage in any guard passing until he has corrected his posture, giving me uncontested attacks until he corrects himself. Thirdly, I have an advantageous angle where I have positioned myself outside his elbows and thus can attack from the side rather than frontally. Seen in this light you can see that attacks that begin with a deliberate attempt to stack the odds in your favor are far more likely to succeed than those where you simply make up your mind to use a certain move and go straight to it. Understanding what undermines an opponents defenses is critical to developing your ability to beat skilled opponents. Just as important as learning moves are the precursors to those moves so that you can create an unfair advantage in your favor before you even attempt them.

"When the workouts done: My students are renown for their work ethic and I am known to push people to their maximum in training. Less well known is that I am also a big advocate of a very informal and relaxed approach to post workout dialogue as a very important counterbalance to the grind of physical training. One of the best ways to create longevity in the sport is to match the toughness of training with relaxed banter and chatting about subjects that have no relation to Jiu jitsu. I am sure all of you do the same thing. It can‚Äôt all be about pressure and productivity - we all need pressure release and dialogue among friends and comrades after class is the single best way to make this part of your Jiu jitsu journey. Remember always that the path of Jiu jitsu is a long and frustrating one and the single biggest determinant of realizing you‚Äôre potential is STAYING POWER. Anything you can do that keeps you going longer is a blessing and nothing does that better than the venerable Jiu jitsu tradition of after class hijinks and banter. Interestingly when the Covid crises hit students all told me how much they missed classes, but the single most common sentiment I got from them was that more than anything else they missed the post class camaraderie. Here I am with one of my most brilliant students and best friends, Brian Glick, talking shop and probably a few other topics well outside the shop as well üòâüòúüòâ What are some of the craziest conversations and antics you get up to when the arm locks strangles are over?

"Climbing: The worst scenarios for takedowns in jiu jitsu usually involve getting your head and shoulders getting caught under a skilled opponents body weight. This is always an exhausting and debilitating experience that usually ends with you getting caught in submissions or scored on. Get used to the notion of climbing UP when you make contact with your takedowns rather than falling down and forward. As long as your head is over your hips you‚Äôll be in a position to work up your opponents body and hopefully towards the back - that‚Äôs always the optimal situation with regards takedowns for Jiu jitsu
"
"Most targets get more difficult to attack as the match goes on - the back is the exception to the rule: I‚Äôm sure you have all had the experience of trying to attack a submission hold towards the end of a match and found out the hard way that the inevitable sweat and overall slipperiness makes it very difficult to control and finish many of the major submissions. Most arm locks and leg locks become more difficult as sweat and slipperiness increase. Interestingly however, getting to an opponents back is barely affected by increases in slipperiness and arguably may even be EASIER. Many transitions to the back are helped by increased slipperiness rather than hindered. Sliding your strangle arm into position also becomes easier with less friction. Holding the back for extended periods of time can be a little more difficult, but nothing that wrist control, good head position and a tight body triangle can‚Äôt take care of. Next time you favorite submissions are failing in slippery conditions - focus on transitions to the back - they will make your work easier rather than harder

"Twenty seven hour flight to Singapore: At Narita Airport in Japan on the long haul to Singapore for Garry Tonon‚Äôs title fight against Champion Thanh Le @onechampionship Its reminder of how vast the mighty Pacific Ocean is.

"
"Walking in the front door: When you first come to engage with an opponent you will almost always have to make a frontal engagement because no trained opponent will give you an advantageous angle for free. You have to go forward and create an initial approach that is neutral - both of you have equal opportunity to attack and defend. The Whole idea of jiu jitsu however, is to gain some form of ADVANTAGE prior to attacking - so you want to think of approaching front door but entering the side door - you have to be able to consistently gain advantageous angle once you‚Äôve made the initial frontal approach. You approach from the front because you HAVE to, but you attack from the side because you WANT to. Learning to cut to an advantageous angle and enter through the side door is a huge part of the game. Make a mental habit constantly working for an angle rather than try to bulldoze through the front. Understand that good opponents will always resist you attempts to gain angle on one side and square up to you to restore the frontal position - every time this happens, switch to the other side, so that you misdirect an opponent and become difficult to predict. Enter from the front - attack from the side whenever possible - this simple insight will add greatly to the effectiveness of your game.
"
"Overlap: Many of the most popular standing takedowns in Jiu jitsu can also be used as sweeps from guard position on the ground. This really helps the Jiu jitsu student speed the process of learning them as standing takedowns. If you already have a strong single leg sweep from open guard, it won‚Äôt be so difficult to lead a single leg takedown from standing position. Once you learn standing set ups and elements of stance and motion etc, everything is quite similar. Quite a few takedowns have very significant overlap with commonly used guard sweeps - double legs, Tomoe nage, sumi gaeshi, collar drags, ankle picks - these (and others) all are excellent takedowns from standing as well as excellent sweeps from the floor. By focusing on these overlap takedowns, the Jiu jitsu student can shorten learning time by taking what is already familiar and applying it in a different context. I‚Äôm sure that many of you have been applying these moves as sweeps for many years - it will be easier to apply them from standing once you make the necessary additions than learning an entirely new takedown that has no relation to the ground game you are so familiar with. If you‚Äôre looking to develop a good standing takedown game in a short timeframe - ask yourself what some of your favorite guard sweeps are and whether they can be applied in standing position - a surprising number can - perhaps they can be your short cut to developing some takedown skills
"
"Directing your weight: I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve all had the experience of sparring with a well trained opponent who doesn‚Äôt appear very heavy, but who FELT extremely heavy when he was on top of you. In Jiu jitsu your ACTUAL weight and your PERCEIVED weight are two different things. What makes you appear heavier than you are is your ability to direct a large percentage of your weight through a small percentage of your body‚Äôs surface area on to a vulnerable point of your opponents body such as the jaw or shoulder.  You will find that getting up into a tripod will allow you to direct your weight down with great precision on to a specific target that can make you feel far heavier to an opponent than your actual weight. Here Gordon Ryan uses a tripod to direct his weight down through his shoulder and make his cross face feel like it belongs to a man twice his weight. Pressure like this can have a devastating effect from top position
"
"Jiu jitsu, age and athleticism: As in Jiu Jitsu, as in life - you don‚Äôt get to work with the body you want, you must work with the body you have. Yes, there are many things you can do to improve the physical capabilities of your body, especially if you have time to work with, but age or a lack of athletic background sometimes mean diminishing physicality that can undermine your ability to perform many of the moves of Jiu jitsu. In these cases it often makes sense to focus on the aspects of Jiu jitsu that are within your current physical reach - at least until you make improvements to your physical abilities. As you progress further in age this becomes an imperative. Indeed, not only must you be more selective in the moves you choose to utilize, you must even become more selective in who you train with and how you train. Every student must learn to adapt their jiu jitsu to their body and their body to Jiu jitsu - as you age or if you have no prior athletic background this will require a greater level of adaptation on your part. Seek to use moves that do not exceed your current mobility level and train with partners who can work around your physical limitations. There are many very good moves that work at the highest level that require very little mobility or flexibility or speed or explosiveness to be effective - focus on these and you‚Äôll be shocked how effective you can be in the mat with younger, fitter and more mobile opponents!
"
"If you can SEE your opponents back - you can TAKE his back: The back is a big part of the surface area of our body - that makes it a big target. Not only is it a BIG target - it‚Äôs a LUCRATIVE target. Nothing else scores more points and nothing else gives more high percentage and safe position to submit your opponent. As such, there will be MANY opportunities to take an opponents back in any extended engagement. In fact there will be MANY MORE THAN YOU REALIZE AND THAT YOU TAKE ADVANTAGE OF. You have to train your mind to see the opportunities before your body can make the movements to take advantage of them all. If you can see even a small percentage of your opponents back for just a second or two - there is almost always a way to navigate your body to his back. Learning to believe and take advantage of this insight is one of the greatest ways to speed your progress and success rate in Jiu jitsu. What the eyes see, the rest of your body can capture - next time you see a flash of your opponents back - be ready to take the prize!
"
"Articulate a broad vision first and then a sound means of getting there: When I teach my first job is to give people a sense of direction - what are we trying to accomplish? What is it‚Äôs purpose? Why is this important? Then I try to fill in the myriad details of tactics and technique along with a training method that can actually allow a student to actually perform that vision in a competitive situation. In this sense I preach a teaching method based around PURPOSE and PATHWAY. Give students a sense a purpose and a pathway to get there. When you have a general sense of purpose it is so much easier to remember all the many techniques and tactics because you know what direction they are supposed to take you. Techniques that are not used regularly are soon forgotten. Details taught in isolation often seem frivolous and unnecessary. But when they are out in in the context of purpose they make a lot more sense and are retained a lot longer
"
"The interplay of push and pull: When playing bottom position in JiuJitsu there is a continual battle for DISTANCE CONTROL that leads to a never ending interplay between PUSHING and PULLING. From guard we always seek an optimum distance that keeps an opponent at a range that gives us SUFFICIENT ROOM TO ATTACK (space creation) and yet at the same time SUFFICIENT PROXIMITY TO ATTACK (space restriction). In short, if the opponent is too close you won‚Äôt have room to move into your attacks. If he is too far away you won‚Äôt be able to get and main connection to attack.  We need to seek a middle distance we‚Äôre the opponent is close enough to attack yet not so close that we our attacks get stifled. As such you must be able to PUSH BACK WITH FRAMES if he gets too close, and PULL HIM CLOSE WITH GRIPS if he is far away. Because things happen very quickly you must be able to switch from pull to push and back again at a moments notice. As a general rule DEFENSE IS BUILT AROUND PUSHING and OFFENSE IS BUILT AROUND PULLING although there are some important exceptions to this general rule. Best of all are grips and positions that enable enable you to do both - such as ashi garami. Next time you play guard pay more attention to push and pull dynamics. When opponents threaten to pass - FOCUS ON STRONG PUSHING FRAMES. When opponents hand back FOCUS ON PULLING THEM INTO YOUR ATTACKS. It will make your developing guard game progress rapidly
"
"Don‚Äôt just attack the joint - attack his balance at the same time: I‚Äôm sure that many times you have had the frustrating experience of locking on a nice submission hold and having your opponent hold a strong defensive posture and then work his way free of the hold. Most submission defense against submission holds applied from bottom position begin with POSTURE and BASE. It is for that reason that whenever possible, go beyond just attacking with the submission hold - ATTACK YOUR OPPONENTS BALANCE/POSTURE/BASE AT THE SAME TIME. This will greatly hamper his defense. Here, Garry Tonon has locked on a very tight cross ashi garami hold and is clamping it in place with a well applied inside sankaku (triangle) leg entanglement. Note how he goes the extra distance against tough opposition and breaks his opponents balance as well - immediately making escape more difficult and with the additional benefit of heel exposure as a bonus. Next time you are locked into an arm bar, triangle, leg lock or whatever from bottom position, make a simultaneous attack on your opponents balance and you will soon find that the balance attack makes the submission attacks much more successful
"
"Life isn‚Äôt fair - neither should be your Jiu jitsu: Fair play is a wonderful thing but not in Jiu jitsu. Your whole game is to create an uneven playing field using mechanics and tactics that put your opponent at a disadvantage that makes your victory very likely. One of the best ways to begin doing this is to trap opponents arms. One of the quickest ways to render a human helpless is to pin his  arms - that‚Äôs why the first thing police officers do with unruly suspects is handcuff them. It‚Äôs a simple way of making dangerous people harmless. So too when you do it it in Jiu jitsu. If you can trap an arm and pin it down you can render a strong opponent helpless. Our favorite time to do this is when you‚Äôre behind someone. It makes the task of strangulation so much easier. Don‚Äôt be satisfied with the rear mount - go further and trap an arm whenever possible (and if you know what your doing it usually is possible ). Defending your neck is difficult enough with two hands - with only one (the other one trapped) is VERY difficult indeed. Make a serious study of UNFAIRNESS and you will have advanced your understanding of the true nature of Jiu jitsu
"
"You can always come back to Jiu jitsu: Life is complicated and often it creates times when you have to leave Jiu Jitsu for a time to engage in other priorities. It‚Äôs natural to think that the time off will be disastrous and then if you ever tried to return you would have lost all your skills and have to start off at the bottom again. My experience is that this is not the case. That in fact, the skills of Jiu jitsu are difficult to learn - so difficult in fact, that they are hard to forget!! What I find is that you quickly lose that fine sense of timing and pace that comes with constant training, but the deep underlying core of your game remains for a long time just waiting to be reactivated.  Your first sessions back you feel slow and out of breath, but the timing and pace control that was lost easily also comes back easily - and then you are right back in the saddle!!Look at the example of one of my early black belts, Steve Williams, from a time long before the squad - he took many years off to engage in other life projects, moved around the country and came back recently to the basement - here he is competing in F2W this weekend in high level competition and looking like he never took a day off! So don‚Äôt worry about the pressures of life interrupting your training - that hard won knowledge and skill of yours is buried deep inside - it‚Äôs not going anywhere - just look at the example of Mr Williams
"
"Killers on the ground - competent on the feet: Over the years I‚Äôve had the honor of working with many elite grapplers from other grappling styles such as Judo and Wrestling etc. What I noticed is that these fellows were always absolute killers on their feet. Some of them were so skilled that they could literally take their favorite throw and toss someone with it from virtually any grip and even determine which part of their opponents body would land first in the floor. They could grip and then IMMEDIATELY throw/takedown. In addition to being absolute killers on their feet, they were also very competent on the floor. They were not elite level Jiu jitsu on the mat but they certainly weren‚Äôt bad (there were a few exceptional athletes such as Flavio Canto and my student Travis Stevens who could match even elite level Jiu Jitsu players on the floor - but they were exceptional). This stood in contrast to many Jiu jitsu players who were absolute killers on the floor but incompetent on their feet. There are some exceptional Jiu jitsu athletes who are very competent in the standing position, but a disturbing number had a real discrepancy between their ground and standing skills. In Jiu jitsu you don‚Äôt have to be a world beater in the standing position. No one is expecting you to hang with elite Judo or wrestling athletes whose primary focus is standing grappling - but you owe it to yourself to at least be COMPETENT at standing skills. When you train work with the ethos that you will become A KILLER ON THE GROUND AND COMPETENT ON YOUR FEET. That is an ideal that is easily attainable for us all and will make your eventual mastery of the sport much more rewarding and well rounded and give you a deeper understanding of the sport we love

"Pressure over time: Jiu jitsu is the art of control that leads to submission. Submission of course, comes from the application of submission holds - but the truth is what really makes the submission holds work in practice is pressure over time that breaks down an opponents mental will to resist and physical ability to resist through fatigue. It is in the context of PRESSURE OVER TIME that submission holds have their greatest and most consistent effect at the highest levels. When you are engaged with someone much lower in level than yourself, or if you catch an opponent by surprise, the submission hold itself is enough for victory, but in a tough bout against an opponent who knows how to defend himself it will be the precursor of pressure that makes the submission hold work

"Heels or toes? Whenever your opponent is standing in front of you there is a question of the greatest importance that in most cases can only be answered you and your opponent - where is your opponents weight centered? Is it on his heels or on his toes? The answer to this question will determine what form of attack and what direction of attacks you will use. Learning to read whether your standing opponent has weight forward on his toes or back on his heels is one of those skills that is often passed over in teaching but has has the greatest effect on whether your subsequent moves actually work or not. Here I use a basic arm drag on a standing partner and feel his reaction between heels and toes. Weight on toes is a good sign to continue the drag forwards. Weight on the heels is a good sign to switch from drag to some form of takedown or sweep to the rear. Failure to pay attention or the subtle but all important weight transfers between heel and toes means you have to use brute force to get moves to work - reading the heel to toe weight transfer well makes for seemingly effortless moves.
"
"Your opponent has two legs - make sure you are capable of attacking both: Its natural in Jiu jitsu to favor one side for attacks. Most of us have a better rear strangle on one side than the other, most of us have a preferred side for the guillotine. In the case of the legs, they are so close together and it‚Äôs so common that an opponent can slip free from your ashi garami that you would be doing yourself a disservice if you could only attack one side well. Take the time to develop strong attacks on both of your opponents legs, because very often as you attack one leg and a good opponent escapes, his other leg will be ready to be attacked. The good news is that because your opponents legs are very close together, it takes very little movement skill to transfer form one to the other. Thus Learning to attack the legs on both sides is not so difficult to learn.

"The magic of half guard: Every Jiu jitsu athlete has a responsibility to excel in bottom position. If you can work effectively from bottom position you‚Äôll never reliably defeat bigger opponents or opponents with better takedowns than you. The question becomes - which bottom position will be your workhorse? There are many choices, each with their strengths and weaknesses. There is a lot to be said for half guard as your bottom game foundation. Any time you work from half guard with a good under hook you are immediately half way to your opponents back and halfway to a single leg takedown. This is a huge potential advantage if you know how to use it. It gives you a definite initial advantage that can be made to work strongly in your favor. Your opponent has to compensate for this with grip and body position and you can play off this compensation and play a very simple but strong sweeping game. In order to shut down that sweeping game he will make himself vulnerable to the initial threat of back exposure and single leg takedowns that he was trying to compensate for! The whole time there is so much body contact that it‚Äôs extremely difficult for your opponent to simply disengage - it can be a real problem for even very tough opponents. If you struggle to be effective from bottom position and are looking for a sense of direction that will work well in almost very context - gi or no gi, grappling or mma, try half guard. The whole method of Jiu jitsu bus to gain prior advantage before attacking, and half guard bottom can definitely offer that if you know the right starting positions
"
"I am very happy to announce the release today of my latest instructional video as the third of the NEW WAVE series OPEN GUARD : THE TWO FOUNDATIONS OF GUARD PLAY. My students are well known for their ability to come out from the start of a match, sit to guard position, and immediately impose an attacking game that very often ends in submission. Their ability to do is based on two foundational skills. The first is guard retention. You can‚Äôt attack successfully if opponents can just breeze past your legs and pin you. You have to be able to hold the position long enough and comfortably enough that you can attack in combinations over time. My approach to guard play is based on the notion of offensive and defensive cycles. The more time you can spend in offensive cycles and force opponents into defensive cycles, the more exciting and devastating your guard game will be. As such, retention by itself is not enough. You have to be able to launch counter offense at the completion of every retention sequence to throw yourself back into an offensive cycle and take charge of the action. I show our maximizing knowledge/denial method of guard retention with does exactly this. The second great skill is leg lock entry and finish. I favor leg attacks as the foundational attacking skill from guard play because the legs are always available for attack and because the legs are your opponents base - if you threaten his base it‚Äôs very hard for him to focus on his passing game. I show how to enter the legs from everywhere and lock on intimidating finishing grips. Once you develop this skill you will be able to keep opponents locked in a defensive cycle for long periods of time and shut down much of their game.

"As long as you‚Äôve got a heart beat you‚Äôve got a hope - Hope and belief are powerful tools in combat sports. If you believe in your mind that you have no hope of victory, you will almost always prove yourself correct with your body soon after. Hope for the future has kept many a struggling athlete in the fight longer than he would have done otherwise and brought about many against the odds victories when all seemed lost. Athletes that lose all hope lose matches. Of all the many skills of Jiu jitsu the two that I associate the most with HOPE are escapes and submissions. Escapes give you the belief that no matter how grim your current position you can get out and fight again. Submissions give you the belief that no matter how far behind you‚Äôve fallen in a match, you have the ability to win it all with a match ending hold. IF YOU BELIEVE YOU CAN ESCAPE ANY SUBMISSION YOUR OPPONENT MIGHT TRY AND APPLY YOUR OWN SUBMISSION SUCCESSFULLY ON HIM IF GIVEN THE CHANCE - YOU‚ÄôLL FIGHT TO THE LAST OUNCE OF YOUR STRENGTH UNTIL THE LAST SECOND OF THE MATCH. If you feel that you lack the ability to stay the course in tough matches, I often counsel a strong focus on escapes and submission training as a great way to foster a sense of hope that will keep you mentally in the fight longer when you come to believe that he can never finish you, but if you got a chance, you could definitely finish him.

"If you can make an opponent stumble you can take him down: Takedowns on an opponent in good stance are never easy. Takedowns on an opponent stumbling out of balance due to some preliminary attack are much easier by comparison. Creating a stumble can be done many ways but one of the best is the use of your feet - ashi waza - just as stepping into a curb mid step will trip and stumble you in everyday life, so too a well placed/timed foot will cause you to stumble. If you can then time a takedown in the midst of a stumble what previously seemed very difficult can now become surprisingly easy
"
"The best takedown for Jiu jitsu: Jiu jitsu is a grappling style mostly interested in ground work, since they is the best place to exhibit its central interest - control that leads to submission. Nonetheless there is a need to be able to get things down to the floor and takedowns are one of the most desirable ways to do this. It is natural to ask which takedowns are best suited to the unique rules and demands of Jiu jitsu. No one takedown is ever enough by itself - even if you had only one favorite takedown you would still need others to support its application. I have always believed that two takedowns in particular have a peculiarly strong appeal to Jiu jitsu athletes and could even be described as the most appropriate for the sport of Jiu jitsu when practiced in the gi (no gi i believe wrestling based takedowns are more effective. These are TOMOE NAGE and SUMI GAESHI. These takedowns do not expose you to submission counters, back attacks, getting caught under a heavy sprawl or counter throws. In a worse case scenario where they totally fail, you end up in open guard - not a bad outcome at all. They come naturally to most Jiu jitsu athletes since they are very similar to sweeps from open guard that we use every day - all that is required is some standing gripping skills and some motion and balance breaking skills and you are ready to start your throwing journey. In addition, these takedowns are extremely suitable  for the awkward bent over, defensive stances that so many Jiu jitsu athletes favor and which can make many forms of takedown feel difficult to apply. I believe that if Jiu jitsu players started investing time in standing Tomoe nage and sumi gaeshi skills, they would greatly improve their effectiveness in standing position - if you were going to pull guard - why not try these takedowns? Worst case you end up in open guard. Best case you send your opponent flying with a beautiful and acrobatic throw that ends with you two points up on top of a disoriented opponent ready to be attacked on the floor. Make a serious study of these two beautiful and effective takedowns and you will soon have a different standing game!

"The power of the triangle:  Oliver Taza had a fine win last night in the Emerald City Invitational grappling tournament last night. It  featured EBI rules and had some great matches. In the finals he came up against talented former team mate Nick Ronan and it went to over time. In an arm bar situation Mr Taza made a transition to a side triangle - yoko sankaku - and took a fine submission win in addition to his other submission victories via his powerful leg lock game. The triangle is one of the very best upper body submissions and one you all must devote serious study to. Unfortunately in Jiu jitsu when people talk of the triangle they usually only refer to one form of triangle - the front triangle - and mostly think of it as a weapon from guard. Interestingly in judo the side triangle is seen much more than the front triangle due to the fact that guard position is not as heavily emphasized as it is in Jiu jitsu and Turtle position is more heavily emphasized than it is in Jiu jitsu. There are five major forms of triangle and they can be done from many scenarios. Only when you see all the types of triangles and the many scenarios they can be employed from will you start to reach your potential with this great move

"
"Two is better than one: When it comes to taking an opponent down the most successful methods in Jiu jitsu are tackles to the legs, in particular single legs and double legs. Single legs are generally easier to enter into - it‚Äôs generally easier to grab one leg than two, but single legs are notoriously difficult to finish on well trained, athletic opponents who can maintain their balance and counter. The great advantage of getting to both legs is that it makes it so much harder for an opponent to maintain their balance long enough for an effective counter. You can get the best of both worlds by using the single leg to get an initial grip and then quickly transition to a double leg. This makes use the prime virtue of single legs - ease of entry; and the prime virtue of double legs ease of finishing, whilst avoiding their respective difficulties. Make a habit of getting to a leg and then quickly getting to the second leg and you‚Äôll find a lot more success getting tough opponents down to the mat!

"The parable of the banker: Back in the late 1990‚Äôs when I was working as a bouncer in NYC I strangled a couple of thugs unconscious one night during a brawl. When things quietened down an older gentleman with a thick Russian accent approached me and asked if I would be willing to work in his club. Bouncers are always looking for extra gigs in case they get fired or have to lay low for a while at their main gig so A few nights later I went to check it out. It was a strip club way downtown in the financial district by the old World Trade Center. The financial district is a hive of activity in the day time but a ghost town at night, bringing in an odd assortment of powerful suits alongside derelicts. It was a small club of mostly Russian strippers catering to boozy traders and dealers - a very easy gig compared with my normal work. One night I had to toss a fellow out who had gotten a little too touchy feely with one of the ladies and caused a commotion. He went without a fight and I stayed at the door as he lingered in the street outside. We struck up a conversation as he seemed a decent dude and he talked about his work which if his story was true, he was very good at. He said to me, ‚ÄúThere is only one skill I need to win in my game - I need to be able to look at a stock and see its true value, as opposed to its publicly agreed upon value. If I can see that most people undervalue it I will buy and I win, since it‚Äôs true value is much higher and will be revealed in time.‚Äù As he walked off i wondered if a similar line of thought would apply to Jiu jitsu. Are there moves out there that are undervalued by most and whose true value would later be revealed so that anyone who invested in them early would profit? A few years later I started my study of leg locks for exactly this reason - they were priced at that time far below their true value. As you learn you might ask yourself, are there OTHER such moves out there waiting for someone to reveal their true value? Are the reasons why we currently consider some moves unworthy of study sound, or just a reflection of our limited thinking? The banker did very well with this approach - perhaps you can too.
"
"Reaching: In all combat sports we have a basic need for defensive soundness at all times. Whenever you REACH for an opponent, whether with arms or legs, you lose defensive soundness. Over extension is vulnerability in this game. KEEP YOUR KNEES TO YOUR CHEST AND YOUR ELBOWS TO YOUR SIDES AND ELBOWS AND KNEES CLOSE TOGETHER AND YOU‚ÄôLL BE DEFENSIVELY SOUND.  When you need to make contact, don‚Äôt do it so much by REACHING as by MOVEMENT. Use either your motion or your opponents motion to CLOSE DISTANCE - that way you can make contact without compromising your defensive structure. So when you need to make contact - use MOTION to close distance rather than REACHING in ways that create vulnerability
"
"Peeling hands: Always remember that most grappling techniques begin with grip. The hands and feet are the mechanisms of grip in Jiu jitsu - if you can peel those hands off and deny an opponent his grips it will be very hard for him to initiate grappling techniques. Learning to quickly disarm an opponent by peeling off potentially dangerous grips before they can have effects can save you a lot of trouble down the road. Just make sure you don‚Äôt focus only upon peeling away grips - you can‚Äôt play a negative game where you only focus on stopping the other guy doing his work - you have to them assert your own positive attacking grips and get to work yourself. The cycle of grip breaking and grip assertion is what allows good athletes to shut down an opponents options while asserting their own - a hallmark of good Jiu jitsu
"
"Age and jiu jitsu: It‚Äôs a question that at some point, we all have to ask - how will increasing age affect your approach to Jiu jitsu? Let‚Äôs start by breaking this down into three questions. First, what do you LOSE in jiu jitsu as you age? Second, what do you KEEP in jiu jitsu as you age? Third, what do you GAIN in jiu jitsu as you age? In my experience you will lose speed, flexibility, mobility, cardiovascular endurance, explosive strength and robustness (resistance to injury and ability to come back quickly from injury). You will keep most of your isometric strength (especially grip strength) within normal range of motion. You will gain patience and mat wisdom. Of course there are things you can do to reduce these losses as you age, but understand that no one has ever beaten father time and you are unlikely to be the first. As you age your game must evolve in ways that reflect your answers to these three questions. Try to develop a game that does not rely too heavily on the attributes you are starting to lose but rather is based upon the attributes you keep and gain. This still gives you a lot leeway to work with. Do your best to keep your physical body preserved as well as you can, but understand that time will inevitably change you physically and be prepared to adapt accordingly along the lines of your answers to the three questions
"
"Improving yourself: The path to excellence in all fields of life is skill acquisition. More than anything else it is your skill level in your chosen field that will determine how far you go. There are two paths to go about this. The first is to improve the skills you already have. The second is to acquire new skills. The first option is easier and far less time consuming. In general it‚Äôs much easier to improve what you‚Äôre already good at than to learn something totally new - so if you‚Äôre looking for fast results - this is the path to take. However, there are diminishing returns on this path. At some point the improvements become smaller and smaller as you try to wring more and more out of the move. At some point the improvements become so minor that a plateau is reached. For long term progress, you have to start incorporating new skills. It can be frustrating at first, as initial progress can be slow, but this is the only way to ensure long term growth. At any given time you should be walking both paths. Divide your short term projects around improving existing skills and your long term projects around acquiring new skills - this way you‚Äôll always be pushing onward and upward
"
"Don‚Äôt be satisfied with teaching moves - go further and teach a PHILOSOPHY of moves - a holistic approach that asks WHY moves are performed as well as HOW. Then when your students look at a performance they see so much more than a series of moves - they see why one athlete is winning and the other losing - and they can take that as a lesson to create their own victories. Many will LOOK, but only a few will really SEE.
"
"If you can beat the elbow - the back is yours: The back is generally the best place to be in a no gi grappling match. Your opponent knows this and will always put roadblocks between you and his back. One of the most important roadblocks he has are his elbows. As long as he keeps you between his elbows - there is no back exposure. Learning to beat his elbow by going under it, around it or over the top of it is this one of the great skills of the sport. Whenever you‚Äôre in front of an opponent keep asking yourself how you can get past his elbow, because if you do, your on the path to victory. Even the most vigilant opponent will at some point get forgetful about the elbow as the barrier to the back. If you move appropriately at that moment you‚Äôll be on his back in a flash - and that may very well be all that‚Äôs needed to turn the match in your favor.
"
"The number one reason for losing training time in jiu jitsu is injury. It‚Äôs a contact sport - you can‚Äôt eliminate injury - but you can reduce the probability of injury by following sensible training protocols and eliminating the most dangerous positions and movements of the sport. I have just released a 100% free video for the jiu jitsu community through @bjj.fanatics that covers in detail my approach to reducing injuries in training - TRAIN SAFE. I hope to be able to offer a simple guide to making the training room a safer place and helping your longevity in the sport. Again - this is a free product - you can check it out any time you want at no cost. This is something I‚Äôve always wanted to do as a way of using my experience over quarter of a century of coaching a program where my athletes train seven days a week up to three times a day and where reducing the likelihood of injury  is a key part of athletic preparation for the biggest events in the sport - I hope my experience can benefit you all. Wishing you all the best and a safe passage to your jiu jitsu goals!
"
"Never forget that training is not about winning - it‚Äôs about skill development. Don‚Äôt worry about winning today - worry about building the skills that will enable you to win somewhere out in the future in a match that counts. The gym is the time for innovation and experimentation and development - save your concern for winning and losing for competition
"
"Priorities: In any given second by second scenario in Jiu jitsu there is a LOT going on. It‚Äôs easy to get swamped by all the information coming in and the need for decisions going out. When it all seems too confusing - prioritize  the most important things and temporarily ignore the rest. For example, when attacking the back in a scramble there are many things to be concerned about - getting your hooks in to score, sinking the strangle hand to finish, winning the hand fight, tilting your opponent to your preferred side etc etc but always the priority should be maintaining CHEST TO BACK CONNECTION. Without that none of the other things are possible SO THAT TAKES PRECEDENCE OVER EVERYTHING ELSE. For any given situation, no matter how confusing, ask yourself what is the single base requirement needed to fulfill all the other desires you have in that scenario - and put all your focus on that until you‚Äôve got things under control and can start to put your attention elsewhere. Using this simple PRIORITY PRINCIPLE will give you direction and purpose in even the most confusing and complex situations in Jiu jitsu
"
"If your back is on the floor - then you know that your opponent can‚Äôt get to your back: There are several good ways to defend your back but one of the safest and most effective is to work to get your back to the floor. Part of the problem of defending your back is that it‚Äôs tough to SEE what your opponent is doing - he is behind you after all - you have to feel it. The beauty of getting your back to the floor is that vision is unnecessary - it‚Äôs simply impossible for an opponent to get behind you if you put the floor on your back first.  Like any escape - hit it early - the longer you delay the harder it gets. Bear in mind that ultimate it will lead you back to the safety of guard - so be ready to pull your legs in tight upon completion

"Victory in Thailand!! Garry Tonon won via second round submission against the outstanding undefeated Russian Sambo/Wrestling specialist Shamil Gasanov at Lumpinee stadium Bangkok. It was a hard fought victory with a perilous start to both first and second rounds as Mr Gasanov showed his wrestling mastery of front headlock combined with knee strikes on the ground (allowed in Asia). Mr Tonon had to adapt his jiu jitsu escape mastery to defend and counter attack from a position of disadvantage and was able first to fully reverse and take his opponent‚Äôs back and then in the second round slip into a rolling knee bar. Mr Gasanov showed the courage and mental toughness associated with Russian fighters from the Caucasus and despite a fully locked out knee bar applied with tremendous pressure initially refused to submit. Mr Tonon had to go back to one of the foundational principles of our leg lock game - double trouble - to immobilize and control such a tough opponent. There is only so much courage can do in the face of physics however, and eventually he was forced to submit to avoid catastrophic injury - giving Mr Tonon an epic comeback victory against the odds. Congratulations to Mr Tonon on a great win that showcased both his skill and heart and also to Mr Gasanov who fearlessly went into grappling exchanges against one of the best grapplers in MMA. Thank you so much to all who helped get Garry ready. This bout was a testament to all the years of leg lock training going back a long way with students and training partners both past and present who helped that journey. Thank you to all our followers who have followed that journey alongside us. Garry needed all his skill honed through that journey to win this victory - thank you to all who helped and followed over the years.

"Over budget: It seems every time we go buy something or invest in some project, the initial price you were given is replaced by a new higher price that leaves you more financially stretched out than you had planned on. Submissions are similar. Whenever you go for a submission hold you will need to control the entire limb that you are attacking. Your opponent will be trying to extract that limb from your control. As a result there will often be cases where your initial clamp on the limb proves seemed adequate for the task, but as your opponent began to resist it proved insufficient and your opponent escaped. My advice is simple - always over budget with limb control. If you are attempting an arm bar - exaggerate the connection of your hips all the way up to the shoulder. If you‚Äôre attempting a heel hook, exaggerate your connection all the way up to the opponents hip. This way when the inevitable resistance comes you will have so much of the limb under your control extrication in the time available will be very difficult indeed. If you need a minimum ashi garami connection fifteen centimeters (half a foot) above the knee to be effective, aim for more than thirty centimeters (one foot), on the assumption that your opponents resistance will strip away much of that and leave you with the minimum. If you had settled for the minimum connection length as a starting goal you would have failed after resistance had been factored in. Factor in the effects of expected resistance from the onset and you will do much better in tough matches. Here I focus on an ashi garami connection all the way up at the hip in case an opponent goes to slip his leg free - this will give me a surplus of connection that will reduce the effect of resistance
"
"The incredible value of variations of shoulder rolls for technical development in Jiu jitsu: Here is a fundamental truth that must become ingrained in your thinking about Jiu-Jitsu: For every MOVE in Jiu jitsu there is a MOVEMENT that underlies it and which makes it possible for you to perform it. If you can‚Äôt perform that underlying movement well, it is exceedingly unlikely that you will perform the move itself well. Of all the various body movements that help prepare you for Jiu jitsu performance, I out a particularly high value on the many variations of ROLLS. Shoulder rolls, granby rolls, forward rolls etc etc. The movement and postures of rolling will greatly aid your development in guard retention, escapes, inversion into lower body and upper body attacks, keeping you safe when caught by a high amplitude takedown etc. Nothjng else does such a great job of making your body move in the manner associated with high level Jiu jitsu athletes. Time spent before and after class just playing around with shoulder roll variations from your back, butt, knees, all fours and standing is time very well spent. As your fluidity increases so will your Jiu jitsu performance. Here, Garry Tonon uses his exceptional rolling fluidity to escape - later in the same match he would use the same movement to roll into a fine leg lock and take a sensational victory.

"Pajama party: Filming my latest video in Boston with the inestimable Brian Glick @bzglick my long suffering student from NYC days and a true jiu jitsu treasure.

"Any time you get your arms cinched around the neck and one arm whether from front or back or side, you‚Äôve got a truly formidable control that is also very close to several submissions. Look for it when ever you can - it‚Äôs almost always available from any neutral or dominant position other than closed guard or open guards where the opponent can control distance. Once attained - you immediately become a true menace to your opponent and he will have to get defensive immediately. It‚Äôs a rather simple grip to apply (though controlling it for long periods of time against a skilled opponent isn‚Äôt so easy) that costs you little in terms of risk and effort and yields great rewards - look for it every time you spar!

"I am very happy to announce the release of my latest instructional video STANDING2GROUND: POSITIONAL DOMINANCE AND SCRIMMAGE WRESTLING. Jiu jitsu students are taught from their first day about positional dominance on the ground - yet oddly they are rarely if ever taught about positional dominance on the feet, in standing positions. Just as it‚Äôs a valuable thing to control position before submissions, so too it‚Äôs a valuable thing to control position before attempting takedowns. This video looks at how to get to superior position and how to use it to make takedowns easier and safer. Then we look at the all important skills of scrimmaging to score and prevent a score under jiu jitsu rules. This is what really differentiates the jiu jitsu standing game from wrestling and judo. We also add the skill of standing submission hold entries. Once you add the idea of submission scrambles into positional scrambles - the standing game starts to look very different indeed. You saw how my students used both to operate very effectively in the standing position in ADCC competition, taking standing entries into leg locks, scrimmaging to prevent scores and positional advantage to makes takedowns look effortless against athletes known for their takedown game. If you want to improve you jiu jitsu standing skills, perhaps check it out! Links in my bio and story

As you get better and better, so do your opponents - so you‚Äôll always be under great physical stress that has your body drenched in sweat and chest heaving, utterly exhausted after a rough round. IT‚ÄôS OK TO BE TIRED - BUT IT‚ÄôS NOT OK TO SHOW IT. Learning to mask fatigue is an important skill in itself. Your opponents draw hope and optimism from seeing you exhausted. A tired opponent who is himself thinking of quitting will find renewed energy and drive if he sees you doubled over with exhaustion with the posture of a beaten man. If you are a competitive athlete (obviously what i am saying does not hold true for recreational athletes, older athletes, beginners or if you‚Äôre simply out of shape due to interruption in your training routine) When you‚Äôre tired, practice holding your composure and posture. No matter how hard your heart is beating and lungs burning - stand tall and composed, face neutral - YOUR FACE IS A MASK FOR WHATS REALLY GOING ON INSIDE YOUR HEAD - when an opponent can penetrate the mask he gains strength - when he can‚Äôt - he loses hope. Controlling your body language under stress is a real skill, and like any skill - it‚Äôs needs practice - practice begins next time you‚Äôre feeling like you‚Äôve got nothing left to give.

"Time and change: When I was coaching Georges St Pierre many years ago at the peak of his MMA career two of his toughest rivals were  scrap pack legends Jake Shields @jakeshields and Nick Diaz @nickdiaz209 They were some of the most difficult opponents to game plan and prepare for due to their great skill sets. Now years later it was great to have them join the squad for grappling workouts while we were in Las Vegas recently. They both still have extremely impressive skills! Life has a strange and wonderful way of creating intense rivalries that fade with time and get replaced by the realization that we all have much more in common with each other than we have differences. I was struck by how different the personalities of Jake, Nick and Georges were in some ways, but in the ways that count for Jiu jitsu, they were very similar!

"Victory in Denver! Teenage phenom Helena Crevar impressed everyone today at the ADCC Open in Denver Colorado. She won the teenage division and then entered Adult Advanced in her weight category and the adult advanced absolute  division. She won gold in both. Even more impressive - she won every match of the day via submission and in less than half regulation time - an incredible performance from such a young athlete. She trains like a true professional and shows a maturity in the gym and competition far beyond her years.  As always she exhibited the full range of submissions from strangles to arm locks and now her rapidly developing leg lock game. Oliver Taza had a great day winning gold in his weight division as part of his preparation for ADCC 2024 and showing his smooth leg locking skills combined with improved standing skills. It‚Äôs great to see these youngsters going out and getting the experience they need to get to their goals!

"When you watch Jiu jitsu: Every time you watch Jiu jitsu you get a chance to train your mind in the same way that every time you step on the mat you get a chance to work your body. See it for what it is - an opportunity to train. Don‚Äôt watch passively. Most people just watch to see the outcome. The outcome only affects the players. In order to benefit YOU, you must become a PARTICIPANT not an just an OBSERVER. That means putting yourself mentally into the action. You must see yourself as one of the athletes and ask yourself what you would be doing second by second in response to the action unfolding in front of you. Passively watching for the outcome is fun - but improvement will come from actively engaging on a mental level where you become a mental participant. Then watching is transformed from being an enjoyment to a source of progress that you can carry over into your next physical training session

"Step on the mat with a purpose: Most people step on the mat to train with a sense of ‚Äúcome what may.‚Äù They approach with a reactive mind and just follow the action of the session. This is fine for those days you‚Äôre a little tired or distracted or just plain out of ideas - but the majority of your training sessions you want to have a proactive mindset where you approach the mat with a plan of what you want to achieve. This gives direction to your training session and almost always results in more work being done, more being learned and a clear idea of what you need to improve on tomorrow. Don‚Äôt step on the mat with your body first - lead with your mind prior to the workout and you‚Äôll have a stronger sense of direction
"
"Now is when it begins: Takedowns in jiu jitsu look outwardly similar to any other grappling sport, but the manner in which they score is markedly different. Takedowns are scored by the amount of control exhibited AFTER the takedown. If there is no control - they don‚Äôt score at all. The criteria of control vary from one rule set to another but most involve the notion of three seconds of control that either keeps at least one of the opponents knees on the floor if he turns prone or hips or a large percentage of his back on the mat for three seconds. Now three seconds doesn‚Äôt sound like much, but in a scramble three seconds feels like an eternity. It‚Äôs usually rather easy for a trained opponent to prevent you satisfying these criteria by quickly getting back up to turtle position. The direct result of this is that the real scoring usually comes not from the takedown but from the takedown and transitions to rear mount after the takedown as the opponent turns to his knees to prevent the takedown score. Thus takedowns in jiu jitsu are very closely tied to ground skills, in particular getting to rear mount to score (and gain the best submission opportunity in the sport). Thus it is the synthesis of takedown and ground scramble (scrimmaging for points in the aftermath of a takedown attempt) that defines the standing takedown game in jiu jitsu.
"
"When every round is tough - keep going - there is a deeper skill to learn: The best time to learn nuanced skill is when your mind and body are fresh. Nonetheless there is a skill that you must learn that you will NEVER learn when you‚Äôre fresh and rested. This is THE SKILL OF GRAPPLING WHILE YOU‚ÄôRE EXHAUSTED. This is a truly important skill. Anyone can fight well when they‚Äôre fresh - but it takes a special discipline to maintain your composure and decorum when you are close to collapse. You can only learn this through experience. There are subtleties to this aspect of the game. You must learn to pace yourself within whatever reserves you have left - to manage your dwindling resources and still get to your goals - to change your goals to stay within your endurance. All these are learned by putting yourself in duress. So next time your mind is screaming at you to sit out the next round - go back in. You will learn more about yourself in the next few minutes than you did in the previous decades before you learned to grapple. Those lessons will be vital for your development both on and off the mats.
"
"Start with negation - then build your attacks: The toughest matches rare those you you go blow for blow against your opponent. You are attacking him and he is simultaneously attacking you. Everything becomes a hectic battle where in truth, the outcome could go either way. Battles like this can be fun and certainly make for excitement, but they do not exhibit the ideal of control that is central to our sport. I usually encourage my students to BEGIN WITH NEGATION. Start each encounter to shutting down an opponents ability to attack through grip fighting, stance, position and motion. Once you have removed the initial danger, then you can really focus on launching your own attacks without the distraction of having to simultaneously deal with an opponents attacks. Here, Nicky Ryan comes into the dangerous guard of Masakazu Imanari behind string grips and stance so that he can remove the initial danger and set up the passing pressure that saw him to victory.
"
"Dual threats: Quite often when attacking with submission holds you can create a threat with two submissions at the same time. As an opponent goes to defend one - he falls victim to the other. Usually one strong submission is more than enough but when the opportunity to attack simultaneously with two arises - you are wise to take it. Think about a triangle attack - whenever you have it you almost always have a simultaneous opportunity to attack with juji gatame armbar, kimura or wrist lock. Here, Garry Tonon uses a specialized ashi garami variation to create a simultaneous threat of knee bar on one leg and figure four toe hold on the other to take a fine submission win over Ralek Gracie. Every submission hold can be used in SEQUENCE as part of a combination attack - but only a select few can be attacked SIMULTANEOUSLY. Make sure you know them - even though are relatively rare, they can be an extremely valuable addition to your submission arsenal
"
"Seeing progress: One of the hardest things about jiu jitsu is the feeling that you aren‚Äôt making progress despite all your efforts in training. It‚Äôs natural to feel this way - you train in a room with other students who are learning the same moves you are and who are familiar with your game. As you progress they also progress at a similar rate and in similar directions since you‚Äôre all products of the same room. Just as a car on the highway next to you traveling at the same speed as you are appears stationary from your viewpoint even though you‚Äôre both moving forward very fast, so too your progress can seem stationary when everyone else is moving at roughly the same speed as you. Don‚Äôt despair - the only times you go backwards in Jiu jitsu is when you don‚Äôt train at all for extended periods of time. It‚Äôs damn near impossible to train regularly with commitment and not make solid forward progress. While it‚Äôs true that not everyone progresses at the same speed and for some athletes in some training programs it‚Äôs possible to make remarkable progress in a relatively short time, don‚Äôt worry too much about your learning rate vs their learning rate. Remember that‚Äôs anyone‚Äôs progress can be derailed by unforeseen issues, injuries or impediments. HOW FAST YOU PROGRESS IS NOT NEARLY AS IMPORTANT AS HOW LONG YOU PROGRESS. Don‚Äôt despair over rate of progress - take heart in the knowledge that if you train longer and more consistently you‚Äôll overtake all those who started faster.

"Obstacles: Sometimes when you run into a skilled guard player and it seems nothing will get you around their legs it gets frustrating. How you react to that frustration will determine your success or failure as a guard passer. We all have a natural tendency when frustrated to get the mentality of a ram and just go on butting heads until one drops. Don‚Äôt get into this mindset. Remember always that it‚Äôs always better to go AROUND  obstacles rather than THROUGH them - guard passing is no different. No matter how tired and frustrated you get, focus on moving from one side to another - as feel strong resistance on the left, move to the right and renew the attack and keep working aide to side until you get the breakthrough you seek. Don‚Äôt just kept hammering away on one side against a good guard player - that‚Äôs a ticket to frustration and eventual failure. If you feel yourself getting frustrated it‚Äôs ok to back off a little and start again. The main thing is to stay on top and work side to side - that alone will usually result in the bottom player working harder than you over time and thus become less effective as fatigue becomes a factor.
"
"If it ain‚Äôt tight - it ain‚Äôt right: The first goal when applying submission hold is to immobilize your opponent. It‚Äôs already difficult enough to apply a lock, don‚Äôt make it more so by trying to apply it on a wildly twisting and turning opponent. Use the tightness of your hold to immobilize him. Once immobilized the next problem becomes slippage. You will need to set a lever and fulcrum in order to break your opponent. If he begins slipping off the fulcrum this will become impossible. What make immobilization possible and slippage impossible is PHYSICAL TIGHTNESS. You will need a high degree of isometric tension around your opponents limb. Learning to set that tension and position yourself appropriately is a big part of your future success or failure. You learn this first in passive drilling. Don‚Äôt just repeatedly perform the move - with each repetition try to find the optimal body position that maximizes control and minimizes slippage whilst feeling for a sufficient degree of isometric muscular tension that does the job without exhausting you. Finding that physical and mechanical tightness is the key to progress in submission holds.

"You always start directly in front of opponents - but your goal is always to move from there to an advantageous angle in order to attack: Every match starts with the two athletes squared off in front of each other, but the easiest attacks are those where you have an angle out to the side, or best of all, behind your opponent. As such, the general pattern of all your training ought to be an initial square off followed by constant jousting for angle. If you can‚Äôt get angle you will have to find another form of advantage (eg level). Try not to settle for attacking straight through the front door (unless it‚Äôs a distraction or ruse for a second attack). You can get away with it when you are bigger,stronger, faster or in better shape - but when you face athlete of equal prowess to yourself, that will be an unsuccessful strategy in the vast majority of cases. Start asking yourself what your favorite means of gaining angle out of frontal positions are. Try to find other methods that compliment your favorites. Be sure to be able to get angles on BOTH SIDES as the more an opponent resists on one side, the easier it will be to get to the other. Remember always that just because you START in front of your opponent, that doesn‚Äôt mean you want to STAY in front - constantly joust for angles and if you get them, your attacks will double their effectiveness. If you don‚Äôt, your opponent will have to work so hard to main square positioning he will be easier to attack by other means

"Leg locks won‚Äôt work in MMA: A very commonly stated opinion is that leg locks won‚Äôt work in MMA. When the squad first began using leg locks in grappling competition, critics immediately claimed that they wouldn‚Äôt work against higher level opponents. Then when the squad started beating higher level opponents in submission only tournaments the same critics claimed that they wouldn‚Äôt work in a points tournament of the highest level such as ADCC. Then when the squad (and others) beat numerous opponents with leg locks in ADCC the critics retorted that they may work in grappling but you couldn‚Äôt use them in MMA because you would get pulverized by strikes if you so much as attempted them. I always laughed and shrugged my shoulders at this argument - the same way I did when the early critics said leg locks wouldn‚Äôt even work in grappling. There is nothing special or unique about leg locks. They are like any other martial arts technique - IF THEY ARE UTILIZED WELL AND AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME - THEY WILL WORK WELL. IF NOT, THEY WON‚ÄôT. Every move has its good point points and bad points - their success or failure is not based on the move itself but rather upon our ability to exploit its good points while avoiding the bad points. I have seen grapplers who used triangles, arm bars, Guillotines, lose control of them and get pounded into defeat - yet no one claims triangles, arm bars or guillotines should never be used in MMA. Moreover, there is plenty of historical evidence of leg locks being used successfully in mma for a long time. Understand that the success or failure of your moves is tied much more to the quality of your applications of the move than to the moves themselves. Almost all of the major traditional moves of Jiu jitsu are capable of winning a fight if your use of it is good. Focus on the quality of your application to make your moves work rather than what people try tell you will work and you will find your own creative ways to victory as Neiman Gracie did last night with this beautifully applied hybrid inside heel hook/knee bar leg lock over one of the greatest welterweights in history
"
"Finding your favorite move: Jiu jitsu is dominated by athletes who have great depth of knowledge by a relatively small set of favorite moves. The moves of jiu jitsu are far too numerous for anyone to learn them all in depth. In addition our cognitive limits means we can only juggle a small number of moves effectively under stress. So which moves should become your favorite ‚Äúgo-to‚Äù moves? Let‚Äôs understand from the start that when we say ‚Äúfavorite‚Äù we mean ‚Äúmost effective.‚Äù There are many moves that are fun favorites but we‚Äôd never use them in a high pressure situation. Finding your favorites is a very personal journey. When you first start out it‚Äôs natural that you will be heavily influenced by your teachers and mentors and inherit their favorite moves since you look up to them so much. As you develop you will start to include famous champions as you observe what made them successful and see that you could incorporate some of their game into yours. The last stage however, will be when your own experience and experimentation becomes the most important source of your individual game. This is when your jiu jitsu becomes an expression of who you are as an athlete and a person. You may be surprised by how few moves you really need to excel in to reach a very high level - it‚Äôs usually fewer than most people believe. Understand also that your favorites will almost certainly change over time and what you know think of as your main weapons may be but a memory five years from now. Whatever you end up choosing - research them with everything you have - you are in a sport where depth of knowledge almost always beats breadth of knowledge.
"
"Pressure over time is the single surest route to victory: You can win some matches with a brilliant opening sequence, you can win some by surprise, some by tactics, but let me tell you - you‚Äôll win most by PRESSURE OVER TIME. If you can create sufficient physical pressure for sufficient time you‚Äôll exhaust and frustrate an opponent to a degree where his resistance level drops below a certain threshold and moves that wouldn‚Äôt have worked ten minutes ago suddenly start working. The higher you go the more this becomes true. Become a student of pressure and the effects of time and you‚Äôll become a consistent winner
"
"There‚Äôs a lot more to the standing game of Jiu jitsu than takedowns: When most people think of standing skills in Jiu jitsu they understandably think automatically in terms of takedowns. However, there are many other skills of great importance. Let‚Äôs consider takedown defense for example. In Jiu jitsu a successful takedown scores two points. A strong counter to takedown that exposes an opponents back and enables you to secure rear mount will score double that - four points. So clearly takedown defense is a potentially very profitable skill that gets widely overlooked in Jiu jitsu. Let‚Äôs look at pulling guard. This is typically seen as a defeatist strategy which intent is to prevent an opponent scoring on you (usually because you believe he has superior takedown skills to you). What if we changed our thinking a little and instead of passively pulling guard, we pulled directly to a SWEEP from guard? Pulling directly to a guard sweep is no more difficult than pulling guard. Now you can use guard pulling as a MEANS TO SCORE rather than a way to avoid being scored on. Interestingly you will score the same amount (two points) as you would have scored with a takedown. What if an opponent pulls guard on you? Most people just see this as an invitation to play the ground game. What if you saw it as an opportunity to score a quick guard passing off the pull? Now your up three points (more than a takedown) and putting your opponent under real pressure from the start. What about instead of pulling guard you pulled directly to a submission hold? An arm lock, leg lock or strangle? Then the whole damn match would be over! You can see that there are many very potentially lucrative standing skills that get far less attention than they ought to. Perhaps you can among the first to develop these and make them a feature of your game and reap the benefits!
"
"Isolation: All submission holds presuppose the idea of isolating a limb/neck from the rest of the body in a way that enables you to enact breaking pressure/strangulation. The idea is to get a big percentage of your body to fight against a small percentage of your opponents body. It‚Äôs difficult to overcome the unified strength of an opponents entire body - but much easier to overcome the divided strength of a single limb that is being held apart from the rest of the body.
"
"Lever and fulcrum: Many of the major moves of this game involve using your body and your opponent‚Äôs body as lever and fulcrum. This is one of the major means by which smaller/weaker people can overcome and defeat bigger/stronger people. Just make sure you use lever and fulcrum to maximum advantage. Adjusting the position and height of the fulcrum and always using the end of the lever can mean big improvements to the force you can generate. Make a habit of adjusting lever and fulcrum PRIOR to applying force - it will shock you how much of a difference it can make to moves you‚Äôve been using for a long time.
"
"Yep - I‚Äôm in trouble: There are times for all of us when we screw up and an opponent gets an imposing position that has us 100% defensive. First reaction? Mentally - don‚Äôt panic. There is not a single instance in history of a bad situation being made better by people panicking - so don‚Äôt. Physically - contract your body so you don‚Äôt leave any loose ends out for an opponent to make a bad situation worse. REPLACE PANIC WITH RESOLVE AND MAKE YOUR FIRST RESOLUTION TO NEVER GIVE UP AN EASY WIN TO AN OPPONENT - CONTRACT YIUR LIMBS IN TIGHT AND INSIDE YOUR OPPONENTS LIMBS. If this guy is going to beat you it‚Äôs because he EARNED his victory not because you gave it to him for free. Get those two reactions - one mental and one physical and you‚Äôll do better than most in a bad situation next time you‚Äôre in one
"
"Counting down: Garry Tonon @garrytonon will face by far his biggest challenge this week here in Singapore as he takes on @onechampionship 155 pound champion Thanh Le @thanhlemma for the World Title. Mr Tonon has gotten to his title fight after only six bouts and losing a year and a half to Covid interruption. Mr Le brings Olympic level Tae Keon Do skills merged with MMA training with double the number of fights Mr Tonon has been in and much longer in the fight game. He can kick with either leg in any direction, and in addition has developed powerful knee strikes both in the clinch and as a weapon in the open against grapplers who try to take him down. He has sniper like accuracy with both hands and once he hurts an opponent he swarms on the them relentlessly to get powerful finishes. This is one of the those match ups where both men are very dangerous to each other but in totally different ways. What Mr Tonon lacks in experience he makes up for with dangerous submissions game and ability to scramble from anywhere to advantage. This should be a fascinating match between two great athletes who have been matched together for over a year but for whom unforeseen delays and impediments kept delaying the bout - until now. Both men are in top shape and well prepared in their own way - hope you all enjoy the show!
"
"If you could only have one‚Ä¶Thankfully Jiu jitsu gives us many fine choices when it comes to submission holds. All the major holds are very effective. They all have their strengths and weaknesses. If you had to choose only one for the rest of your life - make it the rear strangle. It stands above all the others in terms of effectiveness, application under all rules sets, grappling, fighting, self defense - it‚Äôs the best in all of them. Nothing is as certain once it‚Äôs locked in place. Nothing else creates such an imbalance between the offensive potential of your position versus the vulnerability of your opponents. With most submission holds you can choose whatever you like when it comes to building your arsenal - with the rear strangle it‚Äôs not a choice - IT‚ÄôS A REQUIREMENT. Make sure you study it deeply
"
"The basis of your confidence in your offense is the degree of confidence you have in your defense. Our fear is always that if we take a risk we will be punished with by being put into a bad situation from which we can not recover. However, if you know that your defense is so strong that there is simply no situation from which you cannot recover - all fear evaporates and you will attack with full confidence - holding nothing back. If you want an aggressive attacking game - begin your training by developing an iron defense
"
"Pressure to the back: They say that to a man with a hammer in his hand, everything looks like a nail. This is usually said to warn people of being too focused on a single thing and limiting your viewpoint and options as a result. In the case of Jiu jitsu however, heavy focus on the back has no real downside. If you can create a constant pressure towards the back throughout a match, you will experience a lot success. The back can he take. From anywhere - standing, top or bottom - and the result is always good. Make it a habit to pressure behind an opponent at all times from all positions and you‚Äôll find yourself winning far more than if you just drift from position to position and follow the opponents actions
"
"Submission escapes and fear: There are two major categories of escape in Jiu jitsu. The first are POSITIONAL escapes - getting out of bad pins such as the mount, side pins, rear mount etc. These are uncomfortable, tiring and generally unpleasant situations but they aren‚Äôt scary unless they are being done in an MMA context with striking permitted - in standard grappling situations they are unpleasant rather than frightening because pins by themselves don‚Äôt do any kind of damage. The second category of escapes are SUBMISSION escapes. This is where fear becomes a factor. Submissions can do serious damage if taken to their completion or applied with bad intentions. As such escaping from submission has a mental aspect to it that positional escapes don‚Äôt - you have to be able to overcome the natural fear of bodily harm and stay focused on the relevant details of getting out. Once the submission is locked on, things happen quickly and you have to make a quick choice between submission and escape. In the gym it‚Äôs prudent to err on the side of caution. Nonetheless nobody likes to lose by submission and so there is a strong motivation to learn submission escapes. Understand that the further you get into the submission the harder it becomes to extricate yourself. Early detection and avoidance usually gets better results than last ditch heroics. But still, it‚Äôs good to be able to show the skills of Houdini and get out of seemingly hopeless situations and escape. The biggest factors working against you are TIME, INTENSITY and PANIC. When you start out, make sure you have a partner who can dial back the speed and intensity of his submissions to something pretty mild so that you can think without panic and perform the appropriate escape. Practice light and slow and get a gradual feel for the position and what you can and can‚Äôt take. Very slowly start increasing the speed and intensity over time. Like any other skill, practice over time can make what was once a very scary situation and make it quite manageable. Note the relaxed demeanor of Nicky Ryan as he methodically works his way out of a potential heel hook situation.
"
"Learning to fly - and fall: Even if you are a grappler who generally avoids standing position in favor of ground work, at some point you are going to get picked up and thrown hard into the mat - there is no getting around this. Learning to take the impact of a hard throw and get back into grappling with minimum fuss and interruption is very important. Failure to absorb the impact well will at best leave you discombobulated and easy to attack in the immediate aftermath of the throw and ; at worst, get you some time in hospital. Beginners are usually taught some simple solo drills that do a good job of showing how to distribute the impact on to a big surface area of the body and direct that impact onto parts of the body well suited for hard impact - that is what will protect you from harm. At some point however, you have to go beyond the solo drills and actually get thrown if you are to be able to apply your knowledge under the pressure and stress of hard competitive sparring. I know many people who look great doling their solo break fall drills but who fall badly in actual match conditions. The best way for beginners to bridge the gap between the basic solo drills and real world hard throws is to start with one or both knees on the floor and have a standing partner throw you repeatedly so that you get the feel of being thrown fairly hard by real throws but fall only half the distance of a real throw and thus take less than half the impact (because you never fully leave the ground). This is a good way for beginner athletes to get to the next level of confidence in taking standing throws that can help people who started the game later in life and simply aren‚Äôt used to getting thrown in a competitive match. Once this becomes easy for you it will be a lot easier to move on to being thrown from full standing position and your overall safety in hard training will be improved.
"
"One strong threat will create defensive over reactions - THAT‚ÄôS the best time to attack! A strong first attack is a wonderful thing - it will get you a lot of wins if you really excel at that attack. The real benefit in the long term won‚Äôt come from that strong initial attack however - it will come from exploiting the predictable reactions to that attack with follow up moves you have learned to mate with the initial attack. Ask yourself what your favorite attacks currently are. Then ask yourself what are the most common defensive reactions you encounter in response - and then the big question - what are the logical responses to those reactions? Here, Gordon Ryan launches into a move at which he excels - sumi gaeshi from a shoulder crunch grip. His opponent has to contort himself to prevent the sweep - those contortions make him vulnerable to a cluster of follow ups appropriate to that contorted position. This is the pattern of behavior you want to establish in your game. You don‚Äôt need a vast array of attacks but you do need some strong ones that create a genuine threat. It is the threat from which the breakthroughs will come. Organize your game into initial attacks and linked follow ups and watch your submission rate improve massively over just strong attacks in isolation
"
"Your first priority - defensive soundness: I am sure on many occasions you have seen two completely untrained people fight each other. The first thing you notice is that neither is concerned with defense but instead they are totally preoccupied with their offense. As a result the fight looks like it will be decided on a coin toss - whoever lands first will win. The first sign of expertise in combat sports is constant defensive awareness. GOOD FIGHTERS AND GRAPPLERS ALWAYS WORK ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT EVERY TIME THEY ATTACK THERE WILL BE IMMEDIATE COUNTER ATTACKS. As such they never enter into offense with an escape route and positioning that will either deny counter attacks or make them difficult. MAKE A HABIT OF DEFENSIVELY SOUND POSITIONING and you will remove the randomness of outcome that is the hallmark of untrained fighters and replace it with outcomes that heavily favor you. Enter, apply and finish every attack with defensively sound positioning and the outcome will be something you can count on rather than wish for

"Craig Jones and Oliver Taza getting ready for their big matches tomorrow night in Austin Texas: Another big show in Austin tomorrow for Who‚Äôs Number One and @flograppling Craig Jones will take on the extraordinarily talented Tye Ruotolo one of the very best from the outstanding ATOS team. This will be a classic match up of ATOS athletic movement and physical conditioning against the slower more control based squad style. Oliver Taza will take on the brilliant Brazilian prodigy Mica Galvao. Mr Galvao shares a common factor with Mr Ruotolo - he was literally born into Jiu jitsu. Both have practiced at extremely high level since childhood and so bring a level of knowledge and skill to the game far beyond their years. Amazing work again by the promotion to bring such talented athletes out the stage! Craig and Oliver have trained hard as always but they will be very severely tested by such tough and talented opponents! Keep your eyes on this show tomorrow night!
"
"How your opponent behaves in a match is largely determined by you: When you have a match with any given opponent either in the gym or on the stage, your opponent will act a certain way towards you - I‚Äôm not talking about unimportant things like what they say or their demeanor - I‚Äôm talking about the important stuff - the techniques and tactics they try to use on you. THE WAY AN OPPONENT ACTS IN A MATCH WHEN THEY ARE AFRAID OF YOU IS TOTALLY DIFFERENT FROM A SITUATION WHERE THEY HAVE NO FEAR OF YOU. How aggressive or attacking their game is, what level of risk they find acceptable when selecting moves, their willingness to engage - this is largely determined by their assessment of the danger you lose to them.  The biggest fear every opponent has is the fear of being submitted. If they have no fear of that they will attack at every opportunity and without regard for whatever you‚Äôre doing. If they fear your submissions they will approach you with trepidation and be reluctant to use many of the moves they normally like to employ. YOU OWE IT TO YOURSELF TO DEVELOP YOUR SUBMISSION GAME NOT JUST AS THE BEST MEANS TO TOTAL VICTORY BUT ALSO AS A MEANS OF REDUCING YOUR OPPONENTS ATTACKING SPIRIT. Put a healthy fear in your opponent and you will have a lot less to fear from him!!

"Everything important you ever do in Jiu jitsu will be done against strong resistance - be sure to factor this resistance into all your calculations BEFORE you make your move
"
"A little break in the action‚Ä¶Hard sparring is damn exhausting at times. The usual response is to think you need to get in better physical shape via an exercise program. That‚Äôs certainly sound thinking and it‚Äôs every jiu jitsu player‚Äôs responsibility to be in the best shape you can; however, the world is full of people who are in great physical shape but who still get exhausted quickly during sparring. The key is to understand that once a satisfactory baseline of physical fitness has been achieved, ENDURANCE IS MUCH MORE A QUESTION OF PACE CONTROL THAN SUPREME PHYSICAL FITNESS. You must learn to moderate your pace and keep it within a threshold that you can maintain for the expected length of the match. A big part of this is LEARNING TO TAKE ACTIVE BREAKS during the course of the action. Obviously you can‚Äôt just stop moving. You have to be able to lower your activity level to one where you can physically recover, but still be doing enough work to appear actively engaged in the match. The best time to do this is in set positions that limit an opponents ability to increase the pace through movement - this usually means closed guard or half guard or top pins, but in extreme cases it might even include bottom pins. You don‚Äôt have to be moving like a madman the whole match - learn to take some recuperation time in the midst of the action and you‚Äôll suddenly find you can go a lot longer than you previously believed
"
"Joint locks - take your time,
Feel the relationship between joint, lever and fulcrum: When you get an opponent in a good joint lock is natural to want to close the deal as quickly as possible - you‚Äôre  in a potentially match winning move after all - so why not seal it as quick as you can? If you just pull on the limb as quickly as you can you will have success up to a certain level. Beginners will panic tap to avoid injury. As you go up against better opponents they won‚Äôt panic and will skillfully defend themselves. As they move in defense the initial direction you are pulling the joint will almost always crease to be effective and you must shift to new directions to accommodate their defensive movements. This will require you to slow things down and use the lever of their limb against the fulcrum of your body to FEEL which direction you should be applying pressure. This is not the time for one simple pull on the limb, but rather, a time to see where they are going and feel what direction of pull will take their joint in a direction that it cannot bend. Next time you‚Äôre applying a joint lock, focus less on speed of application and more on the feel of the joint against the fulcrum
"
"Working towards dreams: Outstanding New Wave juniors @davis_asare and @helenajiujitsugirl had great performances here in Austin today. Mr Asare won his tournament in his usual convincing style and Ms Crevar continued her amazing run by winning the brown belt title via stranglehold from mount - an incredible feat for a sixteen year old developing athlete. It‚Äôs great to see this path - starting local, building skills and experience that will enable to take successive steps to higher and higher levels until you‚Äôre where you once dreamed of being. I watched this progression in a young Georges St Pierre and Gordon Ryan and it‚Äôs the path you must all follow on your own journey in whatever quest you‚Äôve assigned yourself. Build a dream, create a plan and follow it long enough to see it become reality!

"Speed kills: Last night in Dallas Luke Griffith won his match against rising star Haisam Rida in 24 seconds - this was the second fastest submission in WNO history - the fastest was Nicky Ryan who won in 23 seconds against the great wrestler Tony Ramos. In ADCC they give an award for fastest submission - it‚Äôs interesting to look at WNO and ADCC and look at fastest submission 
WNO 
Nicky Ryan - outside heel hook
Luke Griffith - inside heel hook
ADCC
2015 - Eddie Cummings - outside heel hook 
2017 - Marcus Almeida - heel hook
2019 - Garry Tonon - inside heel hook
2022 - Gordon Ryan - outside heel hook 
Do you notice a pattern here? When it comes to fast submission entries there is an obvious king of the hill. Heel hooks can clearly be entered into and completed in less time than most other forms of submission. This is because they do not need to conform to the standard method of positional control as a precursor to most upper body submissions. Upper body submissions that don‚Äôt require prior positional domination such as flying arm bar and triangles have the disadvantage of working against gravity in their initial application whereas heel hooks attack the lower half of the body and hence don‚Äôt require the difficult act of climbing the body to be applied (made even more difficult when there is no gi to grip). So if a fast and decisive early submission is what you seek - history provides a clear lesson as to what direction you might want to go
"
"Back home in Puerto Rico! It was great to back in the gym today training the juniors for upcoming competitions. As much as I love travel there is a true pleasure in getting back to home ground and into a routine that builds the skills you need to excel. Thank you all so much for the interest you show in the squads development and growth. It was so impressive to see Craig Jones and Gordon Ryan show the skills we work every day on the mat so perfectly in competition. No technique, strategy or set of tactics is a completed project however - so as always it‚Äôs back to the mat to refine and improve what you have and discover what you don‚Äôt! Here Nicky Ryan and Nick Ortiz work on their back skills in preparation for upcoming matches.
"
"As one part of the body gets heavy - another part must get light: Sometimes your opponent will put crushing top pressure on you. From underneath it often feels like his weight is immovable. Be assured however, that as an opponent focuses his weight and pressure in one area it can only be done by sacrificing weight and pressure somewhere else - your job is to find that lighter area and do your work there. Here you can see a situation where as my training partner commits forward to put pressure on my head and shoulders, his legs become light and thus elevation becomes easier. There are many other situations in Jiu jitsu where similar themes can be used. Stay calm under weight and pressure and locate the lighter areas that must inevitably emerge. Once you identify them they will be your escape/attack route
"
"The single biggest demand of Jiu jitsu - use your legs as the centerpiece of your grappling game: The single most distinctive feature of Jiu jitsu as a grappling style is the degree to which it emphasizes the use of your legs as the main weapon to use against your opponent. The entire bottom game is based around guard position where you grapple your opponents body with your legs. The top game is based around getting to three pins, mount, rear mount and knee on stomach where your legs connect you to an opponents hips and torso. The upper body pins that don‚Äôt involve legs - side and north south - don‚Äôt even score. The most extreme example of legs as a weapon is the use of triangle strangle holds. The biggest obstacle every beginner in the sport faces is the fact that in everyday life we mostly use our legs for locomotion and not much else, so when we are suddenly asked to perform complex tasks with our legs we struggle. Developing strong suppleness and dexterity in your legs is thus of the utmost importance for every beginning student. Just practicing entering triangles with no hands is a wonderful way to start your journey into grappling first and foremost with your legs. However you start that journey, how far you progress on it will determine how far and how fast you go
"
"Shutting down grips: Every attack an opponent can every do to you in grappling starts with a grip of some kind. If you can control his ability to grip you then you can nullify most of the danger he presents to you. You don‚Äôt want to take this line of thinking too far and become an overly defensive gripper. Make sure you negate the opponent‚Äôs grip and then immediately go into your attacks so that you maintain a good spirit of offense in your game at all times. Nonetheless it‚Äôs important that you be able to stop an opponent getting to their favorite grips, because once he can impose them things can go quickly from bad to worse. If you can stop his hands - you‚Äôll stop everything that follows.
"
"It‚Äôs hard for an opponent to attack you from guard if you don‚Äôt allow his feet to make effective connections to your legs and arms: Effective attacks in Jiu jitsu are predicated upon effective grips that form connection between you and an opponent. You can use that connection to control and attack. If you can‚Äôt grip and connect - you can‚Äôt attack. Now guard position has two major forms of grip. The first is the more obvious one - your hands to your opponents body. The second is your FEET to your opponents body (usually the legs). Your feet do almost as much grilling as your hands in Jiu jitsu. When passing, if you can shut down your opponents ability to grip you with his feet, then you will have gone a long way towards shutting down his offense, and with his offense shut down, now you can focus on the fun stuff - passing his guard - without the distraction of being attacked as you try to pass. Seek to control his feet and prevent them making effective connections to your legs - your passing game will thank you

"
"Only one position truly merges position and submission - the back: If you look at the pins of Jiu jitsu you will see that as desirable as they are - you still have quite a bit of work to do to go beyond the pin into the submission. Getting side pin or mounted or north south or knee on belly is good, but getting the arm or neck from there requires a significant set of skills. The rear mount on the other hand leaves you VERY close to submission. Unless your opponent has good defensive skills a simple wrapping of your arm around the neck is enough to end it. You can see how closely the position (rear mount) is to the submission (rear strangle) by the fact that the escape from one entails the escape from the other. This is not true for say, a mounted arm bar or Kimura from side or knee on belly. Usually escaping the pin is one thing, the submission from that pin is another. As such rear mount/rear strangle is the single best synthesis of position and submission in the sport. Mastering the art of getting there, staying there and finishing from there is the best way to close the gap between position and submission in your game
"
"Learn to see both perspectives of the situation: When you learn offense in Jiu jitsu most people focus only on the the attackers perspective. Understand that you can learn a LOT about the offensive side of a given move my looking at it from the DEFENSIVE perspective. Once you begin to learn what it takes to get OUT of a move -  this will give you a clearer understanding of what you need to do to get INTO and CONTROL that move. It‚Äôs like looking at offense in reverse and that new perspective creates different emphases that add to your knowledge of offense. So learn both angles to deepen your knowledge of your favorite attacks
"
"Different kinds of pressure: People talk all the time about PRESSURE in jiu jitsu - they do so for a good reason - because pressure is one of the most important factors in deciding winner and loser in a jiu jitsu match. If you can out your opponent under more pressure than he can apply on you and for longer periods of time, you are very likely to win the match. Understand however, that the most commonly understood notion of pressure - which is the pressure of weight - is not the only form of pressure. You can create TACTICAL pressure by getting ahead on points so that your opponent is forced to increase his work rate or lose. You can create SIDE TO SIDE pressure, where instead of using linear weight application, you threaten one side of the body to force a defensive reaction left and then jump to the right with another attack until the constant defensive side to side movements exhaust your opponent. You can create BOTTOM pressure by constantly threatening to stand or heist up from underneath, forcing the opponent to work hard from top just to hold you down. You can create PSYCHOLOGICAL pressure by making an opponent emotional, or fueling unrealistic performance expectations set by him being the favorite or underdog in ways that distract him from tactically sound decision making. Pressure is indeed among the most important elements of victory and defeat - but make sure you go beyond the common perceptions of pressure and try to incorporate more aspects of pressure to make your use of it more effective

"Victory in Chicago! The juniors had a great day at the big ADCC Open event in Chicago today. Daniel Manasoiu @jiujitsugiant won double gold to make an incredible ten gold medals at ADCC Open events this year. Almost allmatches by way of submission. Helena Crevar @helenajiujitsugirl won double gold in the adult division in both weight and Absolute - all matches by submission in another incredible performance by the emerging 16 year old star. Teenage phenom Trinity Pun @trinitypunbjj won gold in adult weight division with another outstanding performance along with several other medals from their talented teammates. It‚Äôs great seeing these ADCC Open events become so successful - they offer athletes invaluable experience in the ADCC rule set as they work towards their dreams and goals. Congratulations to these outstanding youngsters!
"
"Regulate speed of engagement by increasing or decreasing body contact: Good jiu jitsu players have a distinguishing characteristic - they can easily control the PACE set between them and their opponents. This is a truly important skill. If you can control the overall pace and tempo, controlling the outcome will be a lot easier. There is a simple rule in effect here - the greater the surface area of your body in contact with your opponent - the slower the pace will be. You want to speed things up? Decrease body contact. You want to slow things down? Increase body contact. Learn to contour your body into an opponents and you can increase the effect dramatically until you get to a point where you can slow movement down to a degree where escape becomes very difficult and submission becomes very easy. LEARN TO REGULATE MOVEMENT THROUGH BODY CONTACT AS EASILY AS YOU REGULATE THE PASSAGE OF WATER THROUGH A FAUCET and you will have taken a giant step in your jiu jitsu progress
"
"When one part of your body is in trouble - other parts have to come to the rescue: The game of Jiu jitsu is all about isolating one part of an opponents body and attacking it. Sometimes you will be on the wrong side of that methodology and find one part of your body has been isolated and about to be attacked. If you can react early enough then it‚Äôs usually possible to simply pull the endangered limb free. However, if you‚Äôre opponent is doing a good job of restricting your movement you‚Äôll need a more sophisticated approach. Rather than desperately try to extract your isolated limb - look to use other parts of your body to protect it. Here I am being effectively pinned in side control and my left arm has been isolated by an under hook. I react by wedging my right knee at the pocket of my opponents right hip and right forearm at the pocket of the left hip. This immediately restricts my opponents movement and makes it more difficult for him to transition into mount or move around to the other side of my body for upper body submission attacks. There is a sense in which I lost a battle on my left hand side and so I must win on the right hand side in order to prevent further loss. Once this barrier of elbow and knee on the right side has been established, any movement by my opponent will create sufficient space to join knee and elbow together as a locked frame and out the opponent back in guard where the isolated left arm won‚Äôt be any use. Next time your stuck and and arm or leg isolated - use this line of thinking to first protect yourself and then work safely out of the position and back on the attack!

"Getting the gang together: Had a fun day of training with @georgesstpierre @timkennedymma @garrytonon and @gordonlovesjiujitsu I‚Äôve always loved the fusion of grappling and MMA and watching these fellows innovate and explore the boundaries of each was a sight to behold.

"Martial arts in Asia: It‚Äôs always fascinating getting ready for a show in Asia. There is a deep cultural association with the study of martial arts that goes far back into history. Here we are in a shopping mall on the way to the gym and there are statues of Shaolin monks practicing their skills! Up the street there is a small monastery running Kung fu classes. The crowds at events have a good grasp of what the athletes are trying to do at events and a deep appreciation for the athletes. Our study of jiu jitsu in America is largely as a competitive sport where the emphasis is entirely on mechanical efficiency, tactics and athletic preparation. These are here in Asia too of course, but there is also a fascinating association with cultural and religious tradition that gives it a different flavor than the way we practice in the West - however hard it is to pin down and define, it‚Äôs unmistakable when you‚Äôre here and always a delight. It‚Äôs been great feeling the summer humidity and afternoon rain storms of Asia and the Pacific - it‚Äôs a feeling I always associate with my travels here and the first thing you feel when you step off the plane. Now it‚Äôs time to get ready for the big show at @onechampionship tomorrow night - there is a mix of truly high level jiu jitsu, kick boxing and Muay Thai - it‚Äôs going to be a great show!

"In grappling there is definitely some truth to the adage that you should take your time when your winning and move with speed when you‚Äôre losing. Of course no one sentence will cover all the scenarios you‚Äôll find yourself in - but it‚Äôs a solid general rule to follow
"
"Ambidextrous moves: Quite often I am asked if students should aspire to become equally adept at moves on both sides of the body. My answer is that in the case of defensive moves where the opponent chooses which side he attacks, you ought to be ambidextrous with your moves. So for example, in the case of escapes from side pins, you ought to be equally adept on both sides since your opponent may attack from either. If you can only perform escapes from side pins on your right side and he pins you on your left - you‚Äôre in trouble - so practice on both sides. In the case of moves where you get to choose which side you apply the move from - say a guillotine strangle - it‚Äôs ok to be expert on one side and not on the other. Most champions can only perform their favorite offensive moves on one side. A good general rule is that most defensive moves ought to be ambidextrous whilst most offensive moves can be mono-dexterous. Remember that for most moves it‚Äôs better to be truly excellent on one side than average on both sides. The human body itself is not symmetrical and in most cases, neither will be your jiu jitsu - most of all - make sure you are not AMBISINISTROUS - which is a little known word that denotes someone who is completely unskilled on BOTH sides! üòÇüòÇ
"
"Reaching: All grappling begins with grip. That means both athletes will have to constantly reach for each other in order to establish grip and connection. Every act of reaching involves risk, since you are compromising your stance, but you can‚Äôt refuse to reach, since then you‚Äôd never be able to attack and win. So the question always becomes - HOW CAN I MAKE CONTACT WITH AN OPPONENT IN A WAY THAT DOES NOT CREATE AN UNACCEPTABLY HIGH RISK? Much of the answer will be bound up with the other elements of your stance and position - your head position, elbow positioning, the position of your other arm, distance and angle etc. Here you see Giancarlo Bodoni and Lucas Barbosa reaching for their respective grips. Both are careful to match head height as they do so to lower risk. Giancarlo shows his confidence in allowing his elbows to extend further forward while Mr Barbosa plays a more conservative retracted elbow position. Learning to find your balance between the need to reach and attack versus the need to remain defensively responsible and not over extend yourself into vulnerability is a huge part of your development
"
"Glamor skills versus working skills: I think it‚Äôs fair to say we all have an innate preference for glamor moves in Jiu Jitsu - moves that wow a crowd and a spectacular flair to them. Certainly these are fun to learn and can occasionally bring great results, but the simple truth is that the vast majority of both your TIME and your SUCCESS on the mat will be the result of foundational skills. These are the skills that make the application of the glamor moves possible. You‚Äôll never see guard retention in a highlight reel, but all those spectacular arm bars and triangles and sweeps from guard that do feature on highlight reels would be impossible if you couldn‚Äôt hold guard long enough to actually apply them. Think about it in terms of numbers. For every minute of glamor moves you apply you‚Äôll spend twenty minutes in the set up phase. Your training must reflect this. Ask yourself if a given skill ‚Äúwhat skills underly this skill?‚Äù Once you figure that out spend much more time on those underlying skills than the surface skill. This is how you build a game with a solid foundation that will work against tough opponents
"
"Garry Tonon getting ready: Garry Tonon is counting down the days to his next MMA fight in Singapore for @onechampionship where he takes on the very talented Japanese title contender Koyomi Matsushima, who brings a very dangerous mix of Karate and Wrestling into the fight mixed with great experience in high level organizations at championship level. Mr Tonon has trained very thoroughly despite all the inherent problems due to covid restrictions and is ready for action. Sadly i will not be able to go with him this time due to covid restrictions in Singapore that only allow one person to accompany him so we agreed to send a sparring partner for preparation as he has to arrive very early for quarantine purposes and will need to train over there. Mr Tonon continues to expand his MMA repertoire but still we out a heavy emphasis on our style of Jiu jitsu as the core of his preparation. He goes onstage December 4th - hope you all enjoy the show!

"I am very pleased to announce the release of my FEET TO FLOOR: FUNDAMENTAL STANDING SKILLS today by BJJ Fanatics. This is the first of three videos covering the standing gi game in Jiu jitsu. The first volume focus on the key precursor skills of the standing game - stance, grip, motion, off balancing and position - without which you simply cannot perform all the other standing skills. Then it moves to the first takedowns to learn based upon degree of difficulty in learning. The goal is to take a student with very limited standing skills and get them confidently taking down opponents their own size and skill level in live sparring in a three to six month time frame. As such the emphasis is on TE WAZA (takedowns based around the use of hands/arms) since most people find the use of hands and arms easier when they begin than the more difficult but impressive feet and leg techniques that will cover in next volume. Then we go to the crucial rear takedowns that are very important to Jiu jitsu due to the unique scoring system of Jiu jitsu takedowns. Finally I felt that many Jiu jitsu students have as their primary motivation to learn takedowns their concerns about SELF DEFENSE (after all you don‚Äôt HAVE to practice takedowns while practicing the sport, but you will definitely need them in many self defense situations). Accordingly I added a look at my guide to takedown selection and philosophy for self defense purposes (obviously this is done no gi). If you are interested in the Jiu jitsu standing game you can check it out at BJJ Fanatics! I will put a link in my Instagram bio ü§ó

"Last day in Puerto Rico: I had a great time today teaching a seminar here in Puerto Rico to benefit local Jiu jitsu schools and associations running competitions for local athletes. It‚Äôs been an amazing experience watching some of the local Jiu jitsu athletes learn and improve this last year. Today we went over many ways to control and finish from back positions - a favorite theme in my teaching. Tomorrow morning I will fly out to Austin Texas to start in a new locale and doubtless new adventures. Thank you to all the people who helped us train and prepare for competitions this last year in Puerto Rico!
"
"It‚Äôs a lot lot easier to take people down from behind than from in front: Takedowns can be some of the most grueling work in grappling. Not only is the work physically demanding, it can be dangerous as you go straight into many of your opponents best submission counters such as guillotines and other strangles. Often it‚Äôs a lot easier to slip behind them first and THEN attempt your takedowns. Here is Gordon Ryan Ryan practicing his takedowns from standing rear body lock position that proved decisive in his ADCC 2022 Super Fight victory
"
"Reading your opponent: In daily life we all learn to read the body language of people around us and make conjectures about what kind of person they are, what their intentions are and what they really think (often this can directly oppose what they are saying verbally). You have to learn to do the same thing in Jiu jitsu. The primary means of reading an opponents intentions is through their STANCE and MOTION, and by THEIR REACTIONS TO FEINTS AND FAKES that we threaten them with. Use the time you have as you stand or kneel in front of an opponent to read them - the more accurate information you have about their intentions the easier the task of countering their intentions and asserting your own. Here, Garry Tonon approaches Renato Canuto - both athletes are firebrands with dangerous standing attacks, so reading what traps and attacks they had for each other was very important. Any time you are in neutral positions with distance between you, you have a chance to read the other fellows intentions - you got very good at it in daily life - you can get good at it in Jiu jitsu too!
"
"Passing guard as a route to the back: When you first begin the study of Jiu jitsu you learn to pass the guard into top pins, usually side pins but sometimes directly to mount. As you go against better and better opponents you will soon find that they employ many methods of guard retention that make passing very difficult. It can be a very frustrating thing to run into the many roadblocks that good opponents can create to your favorite passes. Understand however, that many of these methods of guard retention are intended to stop passes into top pins, but in doing so they very often create momentary BACK EXPOSURE. You must have your mind programmed to jump on this new opportunity immediately - it won‚Äôt be there for long. Every sequences of guard passing versus guard retention is essentially a PROLONGED SCRAMBLE and as such, the back is one of the best targets. Program your mind to hunt for the back in these scrambles just as much as you do for the side pin and you will double your chances of a score against tough guards
"
"Your body will be a big part of what determines your game: Three things determine what your grappling game will be. Your body type, your personality and your coaching lineage. Over the years your game will reflect the average of these three influences. There is no question that your body type is a very important part of your development. No one knows you better than you do, yet surprisingly I often see students try to take on a game that is poorly suited to their physical body. I am always rather reluctant to tell someone not to partake of a certain game because of their body type - history has shown more than a few examples of athletes who defied conventional wisdom and developed a strong game that did not appear to suit their body. I‚Äôve seen some short legged athletes with great triangles. I‚Äôve seen a few tall athletes who were very good at level changing down to quick and snappy double legs. Nonetheless, experience will guide you in certain directions over time. You will find certain moves come more easily to you than others. Be alert to this! Your own body is talking to you - make sure you listen! Here, Gordon Ryan uses his long leg length to clamp on his dreaded figure four top lock - a move in which he excels and one that a short legged person like me would struggle with.
"
"What do the three most desired positions in Jiu jitsu have in common? The two most dominant positions in Jiu jitsu are mount and rear mount. The best position when underneath an opponent is guard. What do all three have in common? YOU CONTROL AN OPPONENTS HIPS AND TORSO BETWEEN YOUR KNEES. This allows an extraordinary amount of control and also the ever present opportunity for the best submissions in the sport. Make it a habit to line up with an opponent and control him between your knees. This fulfills the Jiu jitsu ideal of grappling an opponent with your legs first and upper body second.
"
"The incredible efficiency and power of foot sweeps (ashi waza): Oliver Taza shows how effective a well applied foot sweep can be last night as he won the Enigma Grappling belt. Just as we all stumble and fall when walking and we trip over an obstacle; so too, if you can get an opponent moving and trip/block his foot mid step, you can stumble him down to the mat (Sasae Tsuri Komi Ashi). The beauty of the these moves is their efficiency. When they work it‚Äôs like a magic trick. Relatively little effort and risk for a great potential reward - now that‚Äôs good jiu jitsu!
"
"Making yourself strong is good - but making your opponent weak is far better: The human body is set up in such a way that it can be impressively strong in some postures/positions, and embarrassingly weak in others. Your job as a Jiu jitsu athlete is always to actively seek to put yourself in strong postures whilst pressuring your opponent into unnatural, weak postures where the body simply cannot exert strength. A classic example is putting an opponents hand behind his back. Show me a man with a strong arm and I‚Äôll show you that same man with his arm pinned behind his back no longer has a strong arm. There are MANY cases where this simple concept can be applied to your advantage in Jiu Jitsu. Whenever you can get an opponents hand behind his back, you OWN that arm now. Seek always to make strong opponents weak by putting them into unnatural positions and you will make your task on the mat considerably easier.
"
"Your face tells the story: When you engage in sparring it‚Äôs good to stay as relaxed as possible to get the task done - that doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôll be limp - sometimes the task requires great tension - but most of the time you can be a lot more relaxed than many believe. This relaxed demeanor creates better endurance and better movement quality, both essential to success. The part of your body that manifests tension first is the face. If your face is screwed up with tension then it‚Äôs pretty clear the rest of your body will be also. Try to keep your face relaxed and you‚Äôll find it‚Äôs easier to keep the rest of you relaxed. If the eyes are the mirrors of the soul, then the face is the mirror of your overall tension level - keep it calm and it has a calming effect on everything else. If you wonder whether you‚Äôre too tense while sparring - study your face on film and it will tell you the truth immediately
"
"If you want to move people - get under their center of gravity: it is never easy to move someone who doesn‚Äôt want to be moved. It‚Äôs even worse when they are bigger and heavier than you. Probably the most reliable means of doing so is to get UNDER THEIR CENTER OF GRAVITY. If you can do this it becomes MUCH easier to lift and move your opponent. From bottom position you have to make your body compact and get down low. You will need some form of effective connection to your opponent - it‚Äôs no good getting under someone if you can‚Äôt stay there long enough to complete a move. A good place to start playing around with this concept is bottom half guard. From there is relatively easy to burrow under an opponent if you can get an arm under theirs and around the waist. Once under their center of gravity you will find it quite easy to roll side to side and carry them with you - that‚Äôs the location and feeling you want - like their center of gravity is floating over yours - once you can move an opponent you can sweep or throw him.
"
"Adjustments: submission holds are an all of nothing affair. A submission hold that was 99% perfect allows a skilled opponent to escape through that 1% error. A submission hold that was 99% perfect that failed scores nothing  LEARNING TO TAKE A MOVE FROM 95% PERFECT TO 100% PERFECT IS ONE OF THE GREAT KEYS TO YOUR PROGRESS. Most submissions begin with an entry that is far from perfect, but good enough to hold an opponent in place long enough for a PERIOD OF ADJUSTMENT that transforms the move into one capable of actually finishing a tough opponent. Learning to ADJUST UNDER PRESSURE is the mark of the submission expert - and it must become part of your game. Submissions START with entry - but they FINISH with adjustment. Take the time to adjust and convert them from decent to good and from good to great - this is the way of the submissions expert.
"
"Using your feet for takedowns: Most Jiu jitsu players spend the vast majority of their training time on the floor - that makes perfect sense since that is where most matches are won and lost and you always have the option of sitting to the floor without using takedowns. So when Jiu jitsu players do use and learn takedowns they tend to focus on HAND DOMINANT takedowns (te waza) since most people are more naturally coordinated with their hands than than feet and legs. This is fine for short term development, but long term you must begin to use FOOT/LEG DOMINANT takedowns (ashi waza) to utilize the greater power and reach of the lower body over the upper body. The learning time is longer but the potential rewards are greater. One of the best ashi waza for Jiu Jitsu purposes are the various foot sweeps. In particular DE ASHI HARAI (BARAI). This move works very well along side the rules of guard pulling in Jiu Jitsu and can send an opponent tumbling to the mat before he can get a grip on you to pull guard. It‚Äôs a low risk move - you don‚Äôt have to turn your back on your opponent and is fairly easy to learn the variations most applicable to Jiu jitsu. Here, Gordon Ryan uses a no gi variation to take an opponents legs out from under him and get off to a great start from standing position.

"Lessons: It was a great pleasure for the squad to train with the great UFC champion Rose Namajunes and her fianc√© Pat Barry. On the surface we taught her leg locks, but on a deeper level she taught us all a much deeper lesson years ago. I was at UFC 217 with Georges St Pierre for his fight with Michael Bisping at Madison Square Garden in NYC. At the ceremonial weigh ins all the fighters came out to square off - it was a packed arena even for the weigh ins. I was sitting there when Ms Namajunas came out to square off against the extremely formidable Joanna Jedrzejczyk. There was a collective gasp around the arena when they squared off as it looked like a child being matched against a powerful adult. I heard someone whisper, ‚ÄúI hope that poor girl doesn‚Äôt get hurt too badly.‚Äù That pretty much summed up what everyone was thinking. The next night we were all in the group locker room warming up. As Ms Namajunas went out for her match, there was the same collective feeling of dread for what seemed like a lamb being taken out to slaughter. Then something interesting happened. The whole locker room, filled with athletes who had fought already and the few remaining to fight, stopped what they were doing and started to watch the terrible mismatch. You could feel an electric tension building in the room as Thug Rose started taking the fight to her powerful opponent. Everyone, even Georges St Pierre, who never gets distracted by anything, stopped their workout and watched this battle of David and Goliath. Suddenly Thug Rose landed a blow that dropped Joanna!! The entire locker room erupted!! As the fight resumed everyone was on their feet and screaming! Then another blow and Thug Rose followed Joanna to the floor and won! The room went crazy!! Fighters who normally don‚Äôt even talk to each other were slapping high fives and hugging, Freddy Roach, who didn‚Äôt even know who Thug Rose was was smiling and nodding, Firas was punching the air and jumping up and down! In all my years of coaching I never l saw anything like it! NEVER count out a trained and motivated individual who has courage in their heart no matter what appearances may say - that was her great lesson to us

"The power of learning: It is always impressive to watch a student take on new ideas and information and then apply it to get to their goals. So often I get messages of students from around the world who watch the instructional videos of myself and my students at @bjj.fanatics and get results in the gym and in competition. One of the most impressive examples of this is the student who actually made many of the videos with me as the demonstration partner (Uke) - @placisantos Placido Santos. Placido got to feel and perform the moves and concepts first hand. It‚Äôs amazing to see how well he has adopted them into his game. This weekend the 150 pound blue belt entered the advanced open weight division of grappling industries and won first place! Using many of the lessons we worked and showed in the videos he was able to take every match by submission! Never underestimate the power of knowledge made into skill through hard training! Hope you enjoy this highlight reel of Placido tearing it up this weekend as I did!

"Lever and fulcrum: Strength plays a big role in the outcome of matches. Thankfully however, there is hope for the weak - it‚Äôs not how strong you are per se, but how much strength you can APPLY in a specific scenario that counts. Your APPLIED strength potential is very different from your raw strength. There are many factors such as position, fatigue level, balance and stance that can make a weak man feel strong and a strong man feel weak - but chief among them is LEVER AND FULCRUM. Just as a weak man can use a long lever to lift a heavy rock that a strong man cannot lift with his arms, so too, a weaker grappler can use his body to create lever and fulcrum to overwhelm a stronger grappler. Again, your raw strength is not nearly as important as your ability to apply the strength that you have - and if you apply it at the end of the lever over a well placed fulcrum - you will be plenty strong enough to get the job done against even your strongest foes. The weaker you are, the more diligent you must be in your study of making your body into lever and fulcrum, and the more you must trust in the mechanical power that it confers to you.
"
"When it‚Äôs time to establish control of an opponent the general pattern in Jiu jitsu is simple - start at the extremities - hands and feet, then work up and past the limbs to the hips, then the head. All positional control terminates at the head and shoulders. Then to finish via submission,
Switch away from the head down to a single limb. This simple pattern you will follow innumerable times on the path to mastery. It is conceptually simple, but executing it on a skilled opponent can be very difficult. No matter the degree of difficulty, this will be the general pattern you follow in the vast majority of cases. Make it your habit and you will be successful
"
"Warm body - cold heart: When you get ready for action you want your body to get warm, but don‚Äôt let your mind get hot with emotion. As your body temperature rises, make sure the heart and mind stay cold and calculating. It‚Äôs natural to get mentally excited and passionate as the action gets closer, but just as you solve mathematical puzzles best in a state of mental calm, so too with jiu jitsu puzzles. The difference is that in mathematics your body doesn‚Äôt have to do anything so there is no requirement to get it ready for action - in Jiu jitsu there is - so you‚Äôll need to get your temperature rising - just try to keep it from the neck down
"
"Pressure passing - the power of half guard: There are many ways to create pressure whilst passing an opponents guard, but in my opinion half guard passing is the best for pressure for the simple reason that it offers direct control of the opponents HEAD, which creates the strongest forms of pressure. The ability to exert pressure over time is perhaps the single biggest determinant of success or failure at championship level. Working your way to half guard and getting control of the head gives you what I consider the best pressure passing method in the game. It works equally well in all three areas of sport Jiu jitsu, gi, no gi and MMA. Here, Georges St Pierre, who uses half guard passing brilliantly throughout his MMA career, trades pressure with Gordon Ryan, who used it brilliantly in his double gold medal performance at the ADCC Grappling World Championships.
"
"Congratulations to one of my best students from the glory days of the blue basement in NYC - Doug Pelinkovic!! Doug was a true training room beast from days long before the squad and earned his stripes training alongside Georges St Pierre, Boris Benyanovich and others of that time. He always eschewed competition as he was an extremely busy businessman. The very first time he entered a competition was at fifty years old - he entered IBJJF Masters No Gi world championships and won the gold medal! Now he just went to Pan American championships and won another gold! He is a very fine example of a student who learned the whole game at a very high level to a point where he was extremely competitive even with the best athletes in the world in the gym and all while working an extremely busy professional life and raising a family. These are the students I admire the most. It‚Äôs one thing to learn jiu jitsu to championship level - it‚Äôs another to do it in your spare time while working full time and raising a family! Congratulations Doug! Teaching every Monday night for years in your dojo in the Bronx will always be one of my favorite Martial Arts memories! Well done!!

"Some moves come naturally and some don‚Äôt: I am sure you‚Äôve all had the experience of learning a move and the first few times you drilled it, it seemed to fall into place very readily. Perhaps later in sparring you got it to work or came close to getting it to work against a tough opponent. It stood out as a move that seemed natural and unforced to you. I‚Äôm equally sure you‚Äôve had the experience of being shown a move that looked valuable but when you drilled it it felt very awkward and unnatural. When you tried it in sparring not only did it not work, it wasn‚Äôt even close and perhaps even got you in trouble. It can‚Äôt be denied that we all have this kind of experience. The question is, what should we make of it? Should we only focus on the moves that come naturally and ignore the ones that feel immediately difficult? That is certainly tempting and understandable, but we can‚Äôt take that option. Some moves, for example an elbow escape, are so fundamental and determine so much of our overall potential that they simply cannot be dismissed no matter how awkward and unnatural they might feel when you begin. Some moves are interesting but low percentage, rarely figuring in top level competition. Even if they felt very natural I‚Äôd be reluctant to invest huge amounts of training time in that direction no matter how natural and easy the move felt to me. The right way to think about it is to take the intersection of both considerations. Is it high percentage - that is, is it successfully used by a wide array of athletes across all belt levels, all weight divisions and all body types over a considerable time period? And, does it feel natural in its application for you as an individual, the kind of move you could employ with confidence and power in a very tough high stakes match? If the answer to both is yes - YOU‚ÄôVE FOUND YOUR MOVE - train it, research it, develop strong follow ups to it and win with it!
"
"The tighter your control at the onset of a submission hold the better you will be able to retain it against strong defensive countermeasures. If you have just enough mechanical tightness at the onset to perform the lock, any defensive movement will take you below the threshold required for completion defensive movement always reduces the mechanical tightness of your submission hold. You need to over budget for the anticipated resistance. If you have twice the amount of mechanical tightness required to break the limb at the onset of the hold, and your opponents defensive movements reduce this by a quarter, you will still be well above the threshold required for success. So right from the start, seek maximum mechanical tightness, so that the inevitable resistance will not be enough to stop you.
"
"When you‚Äôre climbing a rope or ladder - it‚Äôs always one step at a time: The general nature of control in Jiu jitsu is to begin contact at the extremities - the hands and feet - and work progressively up to the hips/waist and ultimately the head. Any attempt to skip steps along the way always comes at the price of sacrificing control. Don‚Äôt get me wrong - sometimes you have to skip steps and lunge for the next grip when circumstances demand, sometimes you can get away with it, but the best general pattern is the same as when climbing a rope, a ladder or a cliff - if you let go and try to jump to the next grip, bad things tend to happen. In most situations it‚Äôs better to take your time and focus on control. Progressively work from joint to joint, grip to grip until you secure the two focal points of Jiu jitsu - the hips/waist and head (and of course - this is Jiu jitsu so you must avoid your opponents guard/legs as you do this). Combat sports always look like scary chaos - and sometimes it is - but the goal is always to make it mundane step by step procedures whenever possible
"
"Heel hooks in IBJJF competition: The IBJJF made an important decision recently to allow the use of heel hooks and associated knee reaping in no gi competition starting next year. It is a reflection of the continued evolution of Jiu jitsu as a sport with the greatly increased prevalence of leg locking and heel hooks in particular and of the ever widening split between gi and no gi aspects of the sport. I believe the IBJJF were wise to limit the rule change to no gi competition. Heel hooks in a gi would be too easy due to the friction of pants and the power of gripping the pants to enter ashi garami holds. It would rapidly devolve into a game of whoever gets to the legs first would probably win and much of the classical upper body skill set could be lost. By splitting the game you have one part of Jiu jitsu representing the classical ideal of positional advancement to the upper body pins and submissions that is safe for all levels, weights and age categories and the other emphasizing the notion of limb isolation and control leading to submission over the whole body. While I do believe this is a significant change and will make Jiu jitsu an even better sport going into the future, I do not think it will significantly change the rankings of the champions in the long run. At first there will doubtless be a few big upsets as established champions initially struggle with some of the changes; but champions will do what champions have always done - they will learn, adapt and grow and use the same drive and determination that got them to the top before to get there again - just in slightly new ways. In time the skill level of everyone will rise to the new levels required and the sport will advance with most of the champions holding their ground. In 2010 Judo radically changed their rules by banning all lower body takedowns - a seemingly huge change - but the same champions stayed on top as they simply adapted their game. After an initial period of instability, the same will happen in Jiu jitsu. One thing is certain - the players of the future will have a more complete submission game and fewer defensive weaknesses and our sport will continue its fascinating evolution.
"
"Breaking posture: Sometimes when you attempt a submission hold on an opponent they feel so strong that you get the feeling you have no chance of success. If they are working from a strong posture you may well be correct. HUMAN STRENGTH IS LARGELY DETERMINED BY POSTURE. Think about something basic like a squat. If your posture is good, you‚Äôll be able to put up some impressive weight, if it‚Äôs bad no amount of innate strength will help and your poundages will be unimpressive. Jiu jitsu is the same. If your opponent is in good posture, he‚Äôll feel impressively strong when you go to attack. If you can break his posture and put his body into unnatural or forced contortions , he‚Äôll feel weak and vulnerable to your attacks. Here I demonstrate taking an opponents head out of position when attacking a standard juji gatame arm bar out of closed guard. By misaligning the sound at the neck you make the usual stacking and postural defenses significantly more difficult. Next time you‚Äôre attacking submissions - attack his POSTURE at the same time and you‚Äôll find success more often than before
"
"Amplitude: There are few things in martial arts more impressive than a well executed high amplitude throw where an opponent is taken up and then down straight to their back with momentum. Most martial arts reward this with a high points score. Jiu jitsu is the exception to the rule. All takedowns in jiu jitsu score the same regardless of amplitude. The smallest trip scores the same as the biggest back arching throw. Interestingly, ADCC is the only major rule set that gives different scores for different takedowns - however, it does not reward amplitude - it rewards POSITION - if you land outside your opponents guard you get an extra score. When it comes to takedowns, Jiu jitsu scores the AFTERMATH of the takedown - where you land and how much control you can exhibit on your opponent post takedown. Once you shift the emphasis from the takedown itself to the aftermath of the takedown, it becomes a very different game.

"I am very pleased to announce the release of my latest instructional video  in the NEW WAVE series - SIDE ATTACKS: BUILDING A DEVASTATING SIDE CONTROL SYSTEM. The side pin  and it‚Äôs variations is the most stable pin. It offers a wider variety of submissions than any other. As such it is often the preferred option in grappling sports where striking is not allowed or rule sets that don‚Äôt award positional points, or hurst regular sparring at the gym where no one is keeping score and submission is everything. I show how my students apply tremendous pressure from side that sets up positional advances and submission holds. When you can play a game that alternates between positional pressure and the constant threat of submission, you will have a side game to be feared. Of all the dominant positions in jiu jitsu, you will probably spend more time in side control than all the others put together - make sure it‚Äôs a strength and not a weakness in your game!

"
"The single best instinct you can build in jiu jitsu: Sometimes the action in jiu jitsu can unfold very quickly and it‚Äôs not always clear in the time available where we should be going in the midst of the action. That‚Äôs when instincts tend to kick in. Some are good, some are bad , but there is one that‚Äôs ALWAYS great - THE INSTINCT TO FIND THE BACK IN POSSIBLE SITUATION. The back is the single most dominant position in grappling, the highest scoring and the best for setting up submissions. BUILD AN INSTINCT TO FIND THE BACK FROM EVERYWHERE and you‚Äôll always be headed in the right direction regardless of where you are or where you‚Äôre going.
"
"Big congratulations to Garry Tonon and Gordon for winning the Flograppling fan vote competition for most exciting match of the year (Garry Tonon) and submission of the year (Gordon Ryan). I‚Äôve always believed that good Jiu jitsu is directed at control that leads to submission and that this style is always an exciting style to watch and learn. These two athletes do an amazing job of representing that philosophy. This is the third year in a row that Mr Tonon has won this award - an incredible achievement and testimony to his attacking style. Both athletes continuously hunt for submissions - just as you should. They have different means of getting there - one is movement based and the other is control based  but the goal is the same. Congratulations Garry and Gordon!
"
"When on top, your first responsibility is balance: It seems there is always a thousand things going on second by second in Jiu jitsu. It‚Äôs natural to focus on one or two things and get caught out by ignoring a third or fourth. Sometimes it‚Äôs good to ignore all the clutter and just focus on most important thing in that position. When it comes to passing guard from top there are a vast number of things that could occupy your attention. You have to avoid getting swept. You have to stay out of submissions. You have to employ some form of guard passing method to improve your position. As your opponent works hard to impose his game from bottom, you can get overwhelmed with all the moment to moment demands of the situation. Understand however that there is one demand that needs to satisfied before all the others - you have to STAY OF TOP. The moment you lose top position you‚Äôre down on points and you can forget all the passes you were considering a moment ago - you will have to swap over entire now to bottom game. Whenever you feel you have too many competing demands while playing top passing - just focus on retaining top position as your opponent goes for his best sweeps and submissions. The longer you hold top against his attacks the more tired he will become and the easier the secondary task of passing will become.

"Driving: An odd thing about my life is that I have not driven a car in thirty years! When I moved to NYC in 1991 I opted never to buy a car since they are not only unnecessary but a real burden in Manhattan. When I traveled For events I was driven everywhere, in Manhattan I mostly used subway and taxis for special occasions. My old Californian license expired more than two decades ago üòÇüòÇ Not only have I not driven in thirty years, but cars themselves have changed enormously since that time. I learned to drive in a pathetic old British car in New Zealand with an anemic 47 horsepower engine! üòÇüòÇ When I drove in California it was in my brothers Chevy Camaro which had an engine with slightly more than 200 horsepower - impressive for that time - to me it seemed like a rocket ship compared to what I was used to üòÇüòÇ Nowadays it seems just about every car has more than 200 horsepower and weighs half what that old Camaro weighed. And many have three times that horsepower!! Re- learning to drive is going to be interesting!! üòÇüòú Here I am playing around with an electric Moke - popular here in the Caribbean Islands. Looking forward to my Puerto Rican drivers license test!! Wish me luck - I think I‚Äôm going to need it!! üòÇüòÇ Especially with Gordon Ryan as my driving coach!!
"
"Turning good into great: Positional dominance is a wonderful thing in Jiu Jitsu. It is very important however, that you adopt a maximizing mindset with regards positioning. Don‚Äôt settle for a GOOD position when a GREAT position is well within your reach. Here, Helena Crevar @helenajiujitsugirl has gotten to the mounted position - that‚Äôs very good - but she does not settle for good - note how she focuses on walking her opponents arm up into extension that takes the position from good to great and opens up many submission holds. Take the extra time to take your favorite pins from good to great and you‚Äôll take your game overall from good to great!
"
"Breaking balance: People will tell you all the time about the power of body weight to create pressure from top position. What they often overlook is that you can use the opponents body weight against HIM from BOTTOM just as easily as he can use it against YOU from TOP - if you can break his balance. From the top players perspective his weight is both a blessing and curse. If he can maintain his balance he can use his weight to immobilize, crush and fatigue you. If he can‚Äôt maintain his balance his weight will make him stumble and extend himself. The whole game then, becomes one of balance. As a bottom player if you regularly make an opponent stumble reach for the floor - half the game is won. The time immediately after a stumble - where an opponent tries desperately to regain his posture and position, is one of the most vulnerable. Attacks that normally seem very difficult suddenly become very easy. The surest sign that an attack on an opponents balance has been successful is his hips or hands involuntarily touching the mat. Practice knocking an opponent down to hips and hands as often as you can. Here, Craig Jones, a young master of off balancing from bottom position, trips an opponent with a variation of a tripod sweep. You can see the immediate defensive reaction of posting a hand to the mat - opening the door for lower body submissions and reversals that are the real goal
"
"How far ahead do you think? We always get told not to focus only on the move we are performing but always to look ahead to the next moves should the current one fail. So if I‚Äôm attempting an arm bar from guard then I ought to be ready to switch to a triangle if it should fail, an then on to an omoplata should the triangle fail etc. it‚Äôs natural to ask - how far out into the future should i be looking with my moves? Does it indicate that I am a better, more sophisticated Jiu jitsu player if i am thinking twelve moves ahead rather than only two or three moves ahead?  I usually encourage students to think three or four moves ahead. Anything more than that becomes a little unrealistic as there are way too many variables that could lead to a totally new situation by the time that many moves have been completed in most cases in a competitive match against someone your own level. Plotting too many moves also has a negative effect. It tends to make us under value and under commit to the moves we are attempting here and now and over emphasize moves that haven‚Äôt even occurred yet. This usually leads to unacceptably high failure rates with the submissions we attempt. Limiting yourself to three or four move chains means you put a solid commitment to the move in front of you but have enough depth to continue attacks after initial failure for realistic periods of time. So arrange your favorite moves in three shot combinations and you‚Äôll hit a sweet spot of realism and idealism - enough moves in a combination to break through strong defenses but not so many that you never commit strongly enough to finish any one of them.
"
"Hmmm...I wonder what the next move will be? When you slap hands with your training partner at the onset of a match in Jiu jitsu you both have an almost limitless number of possible options as far as technique and tactics are concerned. The goal is to take your opponent down a path where his options are rapid taken from unlimited to two or three easily identifiable options. WHEN YOU CAN STRONGLY LIMIT YOUR OPPONENTS AVAILABLE OPTIONS HE BECOMES PREDICTABLE - AND A PREDICTABLE OPPONENT IS MUCH EASIER TO DEFEAT. This is done by locking your opponent into a grip and position from there are only a couple of ways to extricate himself. Experience will tell you what these options are. When you can quickly impose a grip or hold upon an opponent that leaves him with a decision tree with only two three branches - you are on the short cut to victory.
"
"The single greatest advantage of half guard passing methods over regular methods of guard passing - head control: The pattern of events in a guard pass is for the passing athlete get past the feet, knees and most importantly, the line of your opponents hips, and then transition to the head to complete the pass. That transition to the head (the cranial shift) is a constant source of problems, as the defending guard player can exploit the time and pressure release involved in that transition to create strong defensive frames and move back to guard position. Half guard passing methods on the other hand, involve working your way to a situation where your opponent is locked around one of your legs whilst your other leg is free. If you can attain a chest to chest position you can now control your opponents head BEFORE getting past the line of your opponents hips. This means that when you extract your leg from his hold, you already have head control in place and there is no problematic cranial shift. This enables you to impose tremendous control and pressure throughout the pass all the way to completion. Here, Craig Jones shows his ever improving top pressure game, taking a solid cross face grip (the most common form of head control) before beginning the task of extracting his trapped leg. As a result he will be in a fine position to exercise total pin control as soon as the pass is completed.
"
"The majority of every match will be spent in neutral positions where neither of you has an advantage over the other. This is where most of the really hard physical work is done.  It easy to get frustrated by the amount of work required to make even small advances, but have faith that every small advance accumulates as pressure over time that will pay dividends further into the match and turn those neutral positions into dominant ones
"
"If you want to understand something - teach it: When someone becomes my student I always teach them TWO skills. The first is the one everyone knows about - excellent performance in Jiu jitsu. The second is much less widely known. I teach all my students to teach. This forces them to be able to articulate exactly what they are trying to do. Learning to articulate this knowledge greatly clarifies it in your own mind. In my experience THE MORE CLEARLY YOU THINK ABOUT A GIVEN SKILL, THE MORE DECISIVELY YOU WILL ACT WITH THAT SKILL. Often I make my students teach back the skills I taught them, or have them teach some new idea they are working on - the act of doing this always sharpens and enhances their understanding in ways that increase performance. The result is that all of my senior students without exception are truly excellent teachers as well as athletes. It has the additional long term benefit that they can make a good living from the sport as a teacher as well as an athlete. Next time you feel confusion about an area of the sport - do some research on it and try to teach what you‚Äôve learned to a Jiu jitsu friend (or if you really want a challenge - to a non Jiu jitsu friend - then you will have to add explanations as to why this skill is important, since this may not be obvious to an outsider - make sure you make it shorter than my explanations or they may not be your friend anymore! üòÇüòÇ). I promise this will be more than just a fun experience - it will make you a better performer in that area of the game.
"
"Building instincts: I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve all had the experience of sparring with an opponent who even though they may not have highly developed technique or tactics, just seems to have good INSTINCTS. They turn in the right directions during a fast scramble, the pull out of danger at the right moment. Often these good instincts are seen in athletes who started the sport very young. A natural question to ask is - if I start older with no good instincts and I always seem to turn the wrong way, move at the wrong time - how can I improve my grappling instincts? My answer is - START WITH ONE SIMPLE DESIDERATA AND HAMMER IT INTO YOUR CONSCIOUSNESS UNTIL IT BECOMES A HABITUAL ACTION. Once you‚Äôve achieved that, move on to another. I always recommend to start with developing an instinct to RELENTLESSLY SEEK THE BACK FROM EVERYWHERE. You simply can‚Äôt go wrong with this as a habit of action or instinct. Next time you‚Äôre sparring, see how many many times you can visually identify a path to the back as you work. Try hard to seek a physical path to the back. Keep working over time until it becomes a settled instinct or habit. You‚Äôll be shocked how positively it affects your game overall

"Sydney Australia: It‚Äôs been a great experience coming back to Australia to see my family and catch up with the jiu jitsu scene here. Australian jiu jitsu is rapidly expanding in size, enthusiasm and skill. Australia has always excelled in sports as evidenced by their impressive pound for pound performances in the Olympics and many other high profile sports over many generations so it‚Äôs not surprising to see them make great progress in Jiu jitsu. Thank you so much to all the people who came out to see our approach to Jiu jitsu - it was a pleasure to meet you and talk about our game. Australia is as beautiful as ever - here I am In Sydney harbor. I‚Äôve always had a very fond association with Sydney - it was the first big international city I ever travelled to when I was a youngster leaving New Zealand for the first time. It‚Äôs grown greatly in size and sophistication since those days but still retains its beauty and charm. Now I‚Äôm at Sydney airport waiting for my flight back to the US. I‚Äôm sad to leave this great land and my family, but very excited to get back to training in Texas and see my students as they get ready for big upcoming challenges! Looking for to returning here in the future!! üá¶üá∫üá¶üá∫

"The one thing a coach can never give you: A coach can help your technique and your tactics. As you improve in these areas, your confidence will organically grow. A coach can build a room that gives you the training partners and infrastructure to sustain growth over time. A coach can give you a philosophy or vision of jiu jitsu that colors your view of the game and gives you a sense of direction. But one thing no coach can ever do for you is to give you PASSION. That must come from you and you alone. If you lack it, no amount of coaching will help, the encouragement of friends will be of no avail and you will never endure the numerous hardships, disappointments and boredom of a long term training routine. What sparks passion? No one knows - but one thing we all know is when we have it and when we don‚Äôt. Everyone always asks what a coach can bring to you - but never forget the one thing you must bring to the coach - without it nothing will happen.
"
"The spine/head is the longest lever in the human body - use it from bottom position: The first guard you learn in Jiu jitsu is usually closed guard. Often i think this common practice is an error - Closed guard probably should not be the first guard you learn - it‚Äôs actually a very specialized position that does not always come smoothly from the pin escapes that students learn first in jitsu. I often think half guard and variations of open guard may be better  guards for beginning students to learn first. Nonetheless closed guard is an extremely important guard to learn whether you learn it first or last or somewhere in between. Understand immediately that there is going to be a contest between you and your opponent for posture. You want to break him forward - he wants to stay upright and away. It will come down to the pull of your legs and stomach versus the pull up and away of his back and head. Who wins? As always - THE ONE WHO USES THE LEVER TO ADVANTAGE. Your opponents spine is a long lever. If the lock of your closed guard is low - at the base of the lever - your pull will be weak and unlikely to break a good opponents posture. If you shift the lock of your feet higher - up to the head and shoulders - you are operating at the end of the lever and your pulling force will be considerable. When you want to pull - get your feet and legs up high on the back. Much of your success with arm bars, triangles and omoplatas will come out of your ability to switch to a high lock from closed guard - practice it constantly until it is natural and easy for you.
"
"Create a three month challenge for yourself: Getting good at Jiu jitsu is mostly about building strong fundamentals and then developing a few favorite moves (the Japanese call them ‚ÄúTokui-waza‚Äù) and then a collection of other moves that branch off those favorite moves. That is certainly an excellent approach and that should be were most of your focus goes. Nonetheless I‚Äôm sure there are some moves out there that you like but you feel you are simply awful at. I‚Äôll give you an example from my life. I was always terrible at knee pick takedowns. I felt good wrestlers use them occasionally on me and they felt really effective but whenever I tried them I would usually get tossed by uchi mata or lateral drop counters against anyone with good standing skills, so I dropped studying them. In 2003 the Freestyle Wrestling World Championships were held in Madison Square Garden New York City. A dear friend of mine got tickets and after training we walked from Renzos and went to watch the worlds best go head to head. It was an amazing event with super star athletes like Buvaisar Satiev, Yandro Quintana, Cael Sanderson, Daniel Cormier and many others. At one point in the early rounds one athlete hit a beautiful knee pick and I remember thinking - man...I have to try again - it‚Äôs too good to just ignore. Back at the gym I tried hard to improve my application of it. For three months I  tried different methods, entries, sets and finishes. One day I got into a single leg and failed - switched to a knee pick and nailed it!! I never got really strong at it - but I at least got competent at it to a level where I could surprise an opponent with it and score occasionally. Interestingly many years later my students Georges St Pierre and Gordon Ryan were able to use it to win some of their biggest matches - so as a coach learning more about had the double benefit of helping other people to use it successfully even if it was never one of my main moves. I‚Äôm sure you have a move like this. One that isn‚Äôt your strongest but you‚Äôre interested in it. Try studying it for three months and see what you can do. Perhaps it can become one of your back up weapons when your big guns aren‚Äôt working
"
"Once you take someone off the mat - you own them: The second an opponent takes you up and you lose contact with the mat and them - you are no no longer in control of events - they are. Make a habit of digging yourself in underneath an opponents center of gravity and you‚Äôll find that it confers great advantage and gives you an open door to your attacks. The only thing that gives us control over our movement and position is contact with the floor and the opponent - once you lose those, you lose the game of control until you regain them. Make lifting and elevation a big part of your game and you‚Äôll create an expressway to many of your favorite attacks that opponents will have a very hard time dealing with.
"
"The magic of angle: Understand this - any time you are engaged with an opponent, any defensive stance he takes is predicated on the current angle between him and you (usually you are directly in front of each other at the onset of engagement) - ANY CHANGE OF ANGLE ON YOUR PART RENDERS THE OPPONENTS DEFENSIVE STANCE NULL AND VOID. In short, CHANGE OF ANGLE CHANGES EVERYTHING. If you can move to a new angle - DOORS THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY SHUT ARE SUDDENLY OPENED TO YOU - NOW is the time to attack!
"
"Paths to the top: We all want to be the best we can in whatever we decide to dedicate our lives to. In my time coaching I‚Äôve seen many people who got to the top of their respective sports. The thing that always strikes me about them is how DIFFERENT they are from each other in many superficial ways - looks, body type, personality etc and how SIMILAR they are in a few important ways. The most important similarity they all share is their dedication to a mindset of FOREGOING A CURRENT PLEASURE OR EVEN ENDURING CURRENT SUFFERING IN THE EXPECTATION OF A GREATER FUTURE REWARD. This mindset of current privation in favor of future reward is one of the great commonalities they all share. The pattern of their lives is to identify a distant and difficult goal in an industry or area about which they have genuine passion and to lay down a flexible routine that enables them to build the skill set required to attain that distant goal - all this is made possible by a mind that is perfectly comfort with the idea that hard and desolate times now are normal and expected for a golden future. This is not a sufficient condition for greatness but it is certainly a necessary condition. I cannot even conceive of a great person achieving remarkable things without this mindset as their foundation
"
"Opening an ‚Äúescape‚Äù for your opponent: When the mighty Mongols fought for world supremacy they often made use of brilliant battlefield tactics that enabled them to crush almost all their opponents. Sometimes they would surround an enemy and subject them to terrible pressure with their mounted archers - then when the moment was right,  they would create a small opening in their perimeter that must have looked like a miraculous escape opportunity to their beleaguered opponents. The trapped army would be wary of such a ruse. The Mongols would let a few escape, then a few more, then a lot. The trapped army now saw it as a way of salvation - they immediately rushed for the opening - throwing down weapons to run all the faster to the opening, losing all decorum and cohesion. As they sprinted they would form a line to run through the narrow gap until they rushed out and through into what must have seemed like a miraculous escape. The Mongols would watch and wait until there was a long line of running, incoherent, defenseless opponents and then ride up alongside the line, easily overtaking the running men on their horses, and shower the defenseless line with arrows until there was no resistance. Exactly the same ruse can be used in Jiu jitsu when operating from dominate pins. Sometimes you get much better results by releasing pressure in one area - allowing an opponent to move into what appears is an escape - when in fact it‚Äôs just a worse situation - usually a submission. Here, Nicky Ryan gives space from too mount Sinai that an opponent can turn to an elbow escape - and then makes his opponent turn further than he wanted to convert the mat mount in to the rear mount with additional arm control that will make strangulation easy. Next time you have a powerful pin on your opponent but are struggling to finish - think about controlled RELEASE of pressure - on your terms - so that you can direct him into a better finishing position
"
"What opportunities do you see in this moment? Could act upon them in the time available? In any neutral situation in Jiu jitsu both athletes have opportunities for advancement or even outright victory. The first step is visual/mental. You have to SEE and IDENTIFY an opportunity before it becomes possible for you to go to the next step which is physical/skill based, that is to ACT upon that vision with sufficient prowess to get the job done. Every physical action begins as a recognition in the mind. It‚Äôs no good recognizing the opportunities but being to slow or unwilling to pull the trigger and take the physical action required to make it happen. Developing both aspects is crucial. Skill without vision will never be utilized. Vision without skill will achieve nothing. Train yourself to see opportunities and act on them and you will be on the way to superior performance.
"
"Priorities: Whenever you‚Äôre in a bad situation understand this: You will be faced with a set of dangers and problems. Your job is to assess WHICH DANGER IS THE MOST IMMEDIATE AND DRAL WITH THAT FIRST. THEN TO RANK THE OTHER PROBLEMS AND DANGERS AND DEAL WITH EACH IN TURN, BEING SURE TO DEAL WITH EACH PROBLEM PROPERLY BEFORE TURNING TO THE NEXT. Be aware that this can all happen quickly and usually the progression through the problems is fairly rapid. Here, Gordon Ryan has had his back taken. The first and most pressing problem is always the threat of strangulation - so that gets first priority before anything else - hence the inside thumb grip at the wrist with primary defensive hand. Only when the most pressing problem has been addressed so you go to the next. Then you go quickly from problem to problem until successful resolution of the whole problem - which means escape from the position overall and hopefully the beginning of a counterattack. Always have a crystal clear notion in your mind for all the crises positions in Jiu jitsu as to what the first danger is and have a good first response and then work progressively from there. You must be able to rank dangers and problems - once you can do that you can address them by rank - and once you can do that you‚Äôll be a much harder opponent to control and finish!
"
"Started from the bottom, now we‚Äôre here: Too often jiu jitsu players work with an odd ‚Äúgentlemen‚Äôs agreement‚Äù that one will be the top player passing and the other will be the bottom player working for conventional Jiu jitsu sweeps and submissions. This means that they miss out on myriad opportunities to come up from bottom positions into takedowns based on common wrestling movements and which are extremely effective in no gi grappling. Interestingly, because the entire set up process is very different from standing wrestling you can sometimes even takedown/sweep opponents coming up from bottom that you ordinarily cannot take down in neutral standing position. It requires a sense of distance and a mindset that just because you STARTED in bottom position, you don‚Äôt have to STAY in bottom position - that if the opportunity is there, you can change from conventional SEATED or SUPINE positions into KNEELING positions that allow quick shots into the opponents legs. This is a relatively easy mindset and skill to adopt and can get great results in a short time. Here, Georges St Pierre and Nicky Ryan and myself work on getting to the hips out of guard position and multidirectional finishes from there
"
"What‚Äôs next? This is a sport of moves. We learn moves and try to apply them against opponents who also know the moves and their counters. We persist until either we or our opponent gets the breakthrough. Who wins in these situations is usually determined by who integrates moves together best. If we both know the moves and counters it‚Äôs going to be the one who sets moves up and combines them better into sequences that are difficult to follow for an opponent. Accordingly, focus on the move you‚Äôre currently performing but make sure in the back of your mind you‚Äôve got at least one and no more than three follow up moves mapped out and ready to be employed. Don‚Äôt focus on the next move so much that your performance of the current move degenerates to a level where it simply won‚Äôt be effective, but just enough that there won‚Äôt be a delay in transitioning to that next move should the current one fail.
"
"Finding your pace: One of the most important factors in determining the outcome of a grappling match is the least discussed - the PACE of the match. Beyond all the techniques and tactics lies the overall pace of the two athletes. The pace will determine their work rate and if the work rate of an athlete exceed what he is physically capable of for an extended period of time, he will lapse into exhaustion. Exhaustion is almost always a precursor of defeat. Work rate is a fascinating concept. You can work in different ways. Sometimes the work will be isometric, with a demand for static holding strength for time. Other times the work will be movement, with heavy aerobic demands. Other times it will be explosive speed work. Each is tiring in a different way, and most importantly, different athletes usually excel at one type of work but not others. You can exhaust an athlete with excellent aerobic fitness by making him work hard in isometric situations such as pins. You can exhaust an athlete who has great isometric strength and endurance by engaging in a speed and movement match. Learning to keep a match in your preferred work type and away from an opponents preferred work type is a big part of winning tough matches. Know your own body. Know what kind of physical work you best engage in. Create a game and style that keeps you inside that type of work and the ability to keep an opponent there as well. This can often be as important as your skill and tactics in bringing you victory.
"
"What you get is a reflection of what you give: When you drill with a training partner you work cooperatively to research and understand a technique - it‚Äôs a team of two. If one member of the team drags his butt and is day dreaming, distracted or just plain not even trying, inevitably this will influence the other partner in to behave similarly. A substandard performance from half the team will quickly create a substandard performance from both. However, if you come in with a positive and enthusiastic attitude and most important of all - a spirit of experimentation - you will have an uplifting effect. That‚Äôs when the magic happens. As one partner lifts the other a symbiotic effect occurs where each lifts the other in turn and a drilling session can create genuine progress. Next time you‚Äôre drilling take a proactive role from the start - your enthusiasm will lift your partners and in turn his rising attitude will further lift yours - But it has to start with one of you - why not you?

"Impressive day in Arizona!! Yesterday in Arizona the ADCC Open event was held with over one thousand competitors showing up for what is fast becoming the most popular no gi competition circuit. The juniors went out in force under the experienced direction of Oliver Taza @tazagarami Big Daniel Manasoiu @jiujitsugiant had another outstanding performance winning double gold yet again as the stand out athlete of the event. He had nine matches and won all but one via submission. Oliver Taza won gold in his division with a superb display of leg locking skill. Hannah Griffith @hxnnah_jade won gold as did teenage phenom Landon Elmore @landonelmorebjj In addition Abraham, Davis Asare,
Trinity Pun and Reese LaFever all won bronze for a performance that won New Wave the best team trophy once again at ADCC Open. I am delighted to see the success of these ADCC Open events as they give developing athletes from across the nation a great venue to ready themselves for the ADCC World Championships - the most most prestigious event in grappling - and to gain very valuable experience in this rule set. Congratulations to everyone who got to the podium!!
"
"The power of lower body attacks: Outstanding South African New Wave athlete Luke Griffith shows the great power of inverting under an opponent and using the resulting off balancing effect to quickly get himself into attacking position in the recent @grapplefest event In Liverpool England. Learning to attack both upstairs and downstairs makes you so much more effective from bottom position as Mr Griffith shows here - well done!
"
"It all starts with grip: Gripping is the first interaction you have with your opponent in every single match, sparring round and indeed, every single exchange from your first day in jiu jitsu until your last. It is the single most common action in the sport and yet shockingly, the least talked about, discussed and taught. How you grip determines how you act. The quality of your opponents grip gives you an immediate read as to what skill level he possesses. The better you get, the more you will identify GRIPPING as the basis of victory. If you can dominate the grips you won‚Äôt dominate any other aspect of the match; if you can, you will have the initiative in every exchange between the two of you. Don‚Äôt just grab opponents - have an idea of what you want to accomplish first and then grip second, in accordance with that idea. Once you grip - move into the plan - don‚Äôt grip and stop - even the best grips won‚Äôt last long, so grip and move. Having a strong grip is a good thing, but not nearly so important as grip placement and the ability to go from one grip to another in rapid succession. It may not be the glamorous skill in Jiu jitsu - that lack of glamor is why no one cares to teach it or learn it - but nothing surpasses it in importance
"
"Your two biggest positional goals - the back and the mount: When you first begin Jiu jitsu you get introduced to the basics of the positional game and taught the idea of position before submission. This is a great way to start your development. As times by you can get much sophisticated and start breaking down positions, grips and control into very finely distinguished categories. It‚Äôs important however to have some simplicity to give you a basic sense of direction no matter how complex things get. MAKE YOUR TWO POSITIONAL GOALS THE MOUNT AND THE REAR MOUNT. You can never go wrong with that. They are the two highest scoring positions in the sport and the two positions that beat create the physical and tactical pressure that result in submission. From your first days in jiu jitsu until your last - make the mount and rear mount your goal every time you train and compete and you‚Äôll always know where you‚Äôre headed and give yourself the best chance of victory
"
"Victory in Austin!! Nicky Ryan had a great win at The Road to ADCC grappling super fight event tonight here in Austin, Texas! He took on one of the most talented 77kg grapplers in the world - Dante Leon - and won decisively with standing takedowns, scrimmaging up from guard position for wrestling reversals and some fine body lock guard passing. Unfortunately midway through the match he badly hurt his knee entering another takedown - the same injury that prevented him from the Roberto Jimenez match earlier in the year. Well ahead on points, he decided to sit to guard and use his retention skills to hold Mr Leon off until time ran out and took a decisive win. Obviously we will have to get that knee checked out, but still, it was a fine win using his expanding skill set against a top ranked opponent. It was a great night of action hosted by @mojassim80 and @flograppling and great to see the athletes in the ADCC rule set again. Congratulations to Kaynan Duarte, Michael Musimici and Roberto Jimenez who all took very victories tonight - the Jimenez/Ruatolo match was a like a highlight reel! Amazing work from all the athletes tonight. Thank you so much to the many people who came to the Gordon Ryan seminar last night! It was awesome teaching here in Austin and great to show our approach to Jiu jitsu in this great city! Hope you enjoyed the show!

"It can‚Äôt all be hard work and suffering: Sometimes visitors to our gym are rather surprised by the amount of banter and wisecracking there is before and after class. I‚Äôm very much in favor of this. When it‚Äôs time to work - work hard - but when it‚Äôs over it‚Äôs important to have some fun (usually at each other‚Äôs expense üòúüòú). Overly formal atmospheres always felt a little uncomfortable to me. I always disliked titles like ‚ÄúProfessor‚Äù or even worse ‚Äúmaster.‚Äù I always felt that an informal and relaxed atmosphere that nonetheless had a clear sense of when it was time to knuckle down and get the hard work done and when it was ok to joke around got the right balance of industry and relaxation that made training in a tough sport enjoyable. Some of my favorite memories in Jiu jitsu came from times AFTER class and that‚Äôs a healthy thing as laughter and fun have probably brought more students back for tomorrow‚Äôs workout than workouts ever did. Just make sure it doesn‚Äôt degenerate into comedy when you‚Äôre supposed to be doing the hard work - but once the final round is done there is as much benefit in laughter as there is in technique

"Taking opponents down from behind is lot easier than taking them down from in front: Taking a skilled opponent down from neutral frontal positions is never easy and often gets strongly countered. Getting behind them first and then taking them down is usually considerably easier and the counters generally less problematic ( though of course Garry Tonon proved an exception to the rule by countering directly into a match winning leg lock!) Standing moves that get you behind an opponent are thus highly valued in Jiu Jitsu - duck unders, slide bys, throw bys, arm drags etc are all excellent methods of getting behind a standing opponent and making your job of taking them down into controlling positions on the mat much easier and safer. Make sure you make a concerted effort to slip behind opponents at all times in standing position. Even if you don‚Äôt succeed it will often open doors to more conventional frontal takedowns and if you do succeed, you‚Äôll make your job a lot easier and less risky
"
"Attack his stance first - everything else second: The strength of an opponents defense is directly proportional to the strength/integrity of his stance. The better the stance, the stronger his defense. Your goal then, is to break his stance prior to attacking. Understand that a good opponent will recover quickly whenever his stance is compromised, so once you‚Äôve broken it - don‚Äôt procrastinate - attack! Push and pull are always the basis of attacking an opponents stance - all the major methods fall into those two categories - add the notion of tripping an opponent while pushing and pulling and you will be able to disrupt even a very strong stance. Make it your priority every time you‚Äôre about to attack and those attacks of yours will be much more successful!
"
"Offensive asymmetry is the goal: One of the fundamental goals of Jiu jitsu is to create offensive asymmetry, that is, to put yourself in positions where you can attack your opponent much more readily and in more powerful fashion than he can attack you. So for example, in a self defense fighting situation getting mounted on an adversary will allow you to strike with fists and elbows much more effectively than an opponent underneath you can strike back. In a grappling situation the rear mount/back creates the greatest asymmetry. Once you get behind someone all your submission attacks become significantly easier whilst an opponent is left with only a few low percentage offensive options and is essentially one hundred percent defensive while you are one hundred percent offensive - this should always be your goal

"Showdown in Texas tomorrow night: Tomorrow night night In Austin Texas for WNO grappling. Squad seniors Gordon Ryan and Craig Jones will take on two extremely talented opponents. In the co main event Gordon Ryan will take on Jiu jitsu dynamo Roberto Jim√©nez - one of the most talented of the new generation Jiu jitsu players.  They have battled each other in the gym before and it was a war! The stage always adds something to the equation so this should be a fascinating match where they both know what they have to do to beat each other based on past experience and the one who finds their path onstage will take it. In the main event Australian grappling superstar Craig Jones takes on a surging star among the new generation Jiu jitsu athletes - Ronaldo Jr - who has been tearing up the competition scene recently. He is one of the fastest men in Jiu jitsu, very difficult to control. He is a star member of team ATOS, so you know he will be very well prepared and in tremendous shape. They always do a good job of sending their athletes out in peak condition and with a well worked out strategy. Both are fascinating match ups. I have always said that there are two main ways to excel in Jiu jitsu.  You can either make yourself a master of movement and make movement your weapon; or you can make yourself a master of preventing movement and make control your weapon. Mr Ryan and Mr Jones are both true masters of CONTROLLING movement - but both of their opponents are masters of CREATING movement - so this will be a fascinating clash of styles! Weigh in is tonight here in Austin and then tomorrow night @flograppling will broadcast the action - i hope you enjoy the show!!
"
"The first thing an opponent requires to be effective is balance - if you attack that at every opportunity you can wreak havoc with whatever plan he had to beat you with and at the same time, make every move you intended to beat him with much easier to execute
"
"A very impressive performance! Big Daniel Manasoiu @jiujitsugiant competed at a submission only event in Houston Texas @submissionhunterpro yesterday that featured some very talented black belt competitors. Dan won all three matches by submission to take first place. Interestingly he chose to win via the same move - mounted suffocation/asphyxiation - this is a very difficult submission to pull off against strong opposition. In addition he was able to show excellent sweeps from bottom, takedowns/throws from standing and fine guard passes into pin transitions to get the position required for suffocation. People often think of heavyweight jiu jitsu as slow and awkward, but I teach the same moves to heavyweights as lights and with the same expectations for precision - the results really surprise people when they see a heavyweight moving light a much lighter athlete. Congratulations Dan!! That was a very impressive performance!

"
"Control the hips: The only scoring position from the back in Jiu Jitsu is rear mount. This involves hooking your two legs into your opponents hips. There are many other back controls that don‚Äôt involve the legs at all. They don‚Äôt score but are nonetheless very useful methods of control that can win matches. My favorite involve the use of tight waist grips that offer direct control of an opponents hip with an arm. It does a fine job of giving you hip to hip connection along with a great ability to off balance an opponent and leaves you with a free arm that can be put anywhere in response to rapid changes as the match unfolds. When you don‚Äôt have hooks in - throw in a tight waist grip as an excellent means of dynamic control
"
"Push and pull: Everything in Jiu jitsu starts with getting to grips and starting with a push/pull dynamic that off balances an opponent, breaks his stance and creates reaction which you can capitalize upon. In a closely contested match it will usually be the athlete who best uses the fundamental push/pull dynamic at the onset of every sequence who prevails. It seems like such a simple idea, but it takes real discipline to employ it every single time you come to grips and real skill to use it open the doors to attack upon an opponent who has cast iron defense
"
"Know what you want - Train your mind to see opportunities where it is possible - act decisively. At first people will say you are just lucky. When things keep going in your favor, they will say you are somehow gifted - but in truth, you are simply someone who knows what they want and can see when it‚Äôs available.
"
"Nothing ever gets better by panicking: Pretty much every time we spar your opponent will do something that catches you and you‚Äôll have to dig yourself out of trouble. It‚Äôs perfectly normal to feel some anxiety when an opponent is getting into a position that could finish you or score on you - but realize this from the start - however natural it is to feel the beginnings of panic when things go wrong, PANIC NEVER HELPS PERFORMANCE. It will be SOUND PERFORMANCE that gets you out of bad situations, not EMOTIONAL ZEAL. Step number one in getting out of bad situations is the simple admonition to CALM THE FUCK DOWN - everything is secondary to that. When things go wrong your mental direction should always be towards increased FOCUS and ALERTNESS, never panic. Next time your battling out of danger, don‚Äôt start with panic and blind instinct - start with ASSESSMENT and CALCULATION - and realize that the only way this is possible is with a relatively calm mind.

"Symbols: I am often asked why I sometimes present students with a knife or sword after a significant achievement. I believe strongly in the value of symbols in our lives as a means of clarifying, representing and reminding us of ideas that are important, and I believe blades have a good deal of symbolic meaning in martial arts. Bladed tools and weapons were one of the first great instances of technology taking mankind from our primitive beginnings at the bottom of the animal kingdom and taking us out of the common food chain as dominant over other animal species. Naked, we humans are among the most feeble of animals, but with spear in hand, we among the most formidable. Just as Jiu jitsu is a technology that takes us from feeble helplessness in the face of confrontation to a formidable adversary for even much stronger and more aggressive tormentors. Knives, like Jiu Jitsu, are morally neutral. They can be used to perform good deeds, save lives - and they can be used for murder. Like Jiu jitsu they are only as good or bad as the person using them. Steel, the basis of blades, goes through a metamorphosis from clumps of iron ore and through knowledge, refinement and extreme pressure, is forged into beautiful shining steel, just as we begin as unpromising, clumsy white belts and are subjected to pressure and knowledge that transforms us into black belts. Steel requires maintenance, just like the skills of Jiu jitsu. Even the finest steel will lose its edge and rust if poorly cared for, just as your skills will soon deteriorate without continual training and care. Blade steel must seek to satisfy inherently conflicting demands between toughness and hardness - this is the true riddle of steel. Softer steel is tough and won‚Äôt chip or break with rough use, but because it is soft it won‚Äôt hold a sharp edge for long. Hard steel holds an edge well but chips or even breaks due to its brittleness. So too with our training. We seek hard training for realism, but softer training for longevity and technical development - finding the right compromise between those two is our riddle. And so every time you see a beautiful blade you are reminded of these Jiu Jitsu themes

"
"Pace: The three biggest factors that will determine the outcome of a match will always be technique, tactics and physical/mental attributes. Nonetheless there are other factors going on in a match that play a big role in determining the outcome. One of these is PACE. Every match at a given time has a pace - this can vary throughout a match. Every athlete has a preferred pace - some like it slow, some like it fast. It is very much in your interest to open as close to your preferred pace and as far from your opponents preferred pace as possible. Things get interesting when both of you prefer a similar pace. Then you have to decide whether it‚Äôs better to stay in your preferred pace (which is also the opponents preferred pace) or take the risk of going out of your comfort zone pace on the understanding that perhaps your opponent will be even more uncomfortable at that pace then you are. If you can play different paces well this can be a big tactical advantage when you come against an opponent who only plays at one pace. In class learn to experiment with pace. Understand that different paces require different physical demands on your part. In your early experiments you will find immediately that you get out of breath more quickly than usual. When you go slower than normal you will often find considerable lactic acid build up and cramps as you clamp down on an opponent with isometric tension to slow him down. Getting used to this different set of physical demands can be tough at first but it can give you considerable tactical advantage to switch pace during a match against an opponent who can‚Äôt follow the change.
"
"One move - many variations: When we begin Jiu jitsu we talk about a given move in the singular - we talk about an ‚Äúarm bar.‚Äù As you develop you come to realize there are other variations of the arm bar - they are still arm bars insofar as they share the same basic mechanics - but the applications and positioning are quite different. All the major moves of Jiu jitsu have this feature and it is crucial for your development that you understand each of the variations and how they relate to each other. This is a BIG part of what expertise in the sport means. As the skill of your opponents increases you will be required to show ever increasing knowledge of the nuances of variations and switching between them in order to defeat determined and skillful resistance. Here, Gordon Ryan applies one his favorite arm bar variations that does not have a crossface leg at all. This would seem to be a weakness, but the strong control over the near side shoulder makes direct head control unnecessary. Note that he has to switch the breaking fulcrum from right hip to left hip to get optimal breaking pressure with this variation. This kind of nuanced understanding of the variations is what you will require the further into the sport you go.
"
"Step by step: Jiu Jitsu is a game of incremental progressions towards a goal. The goal is always submission, but to get there you‚Äôll need to to pass a chain of events and steps that can stretch out very long at times. It‚Äôll start with initial contact and grip and progress through ever increasing body contact and in most cases increasingly dominant positions characterized by your ability to either get behind your opponent or get past his legs into upper body pins. As you spar always think in terms of the next steps. You know the goal - what‚Äôs the next step? What do you have to do to complete that step? If you complete that step what‚Äôs the next step after that? This is the mindset you‚Äôll need to work with at all times. The long distance vision is always clear and simple - it‚Äôs the myopic vision of the next step that‚Äôll be less clear to you in the heat of sparring - but work within this pattern every day and soon enough things will become clear to you
"
"Getting ready: Neiman Gracie has been training hard for his biggest test yet against one of the greatest welterweights of his generation - Jon Fitch - we are in Connecticut getting ready for the big show with Bellator MMA. Mr Fitch is legendarily tough with a game that shut down the best opponents - but Neiman has world class Jiu jitsu and has shown a great ability to use it effectively in the cage - this will be a great match!
"
"It‚Äôs a game of high pressure decision making - if you can stay composed throughout you‚Äôll have a big advantage over opponents that can‚Äôt. Composure always helps decision making - practice keeping composure the same way you practice all your other skills - it‚Äôs every bit as important
"
"Scrimmaging up from bottom position: So often when we practice Jiu jitsu we carry in our heads a strange ‚Äúgentleman‚Äôs agreement‚Äù that if you are the bottom player, you will remain in bottom position until you get a submission or a conventional Jiu jitsu sweep. This blinds us to myriad attacking opportunities that arise whenever space develops between you and the top player. This space can very often be used to come up off your back and into reversals based upon wrestling type movements normally associated with standing grappling. These score every bit as effectively as the more conventional sweeps of Jiu jitsu and form an ideal compliment to a traditional Jiu jitsu guard game, particularly when playing without a gi. You don‚Äôt have to be the best wrestler in the room to get them to work well for you. Often it is easier to get them to work because your opponent is distracted or caught out of stance due to the submission threat or an initial sweep attempt that breaks his balance. You will often surprise yourself by successfully using reversals from guard on opponents that you really struggle to take down in standing position. Look that sweep/submission/takedown interface in your guard game - the results may impress you!

"When in bottom position - Attack their balance first and everything else second - this simple insight will make you far more effective when working underneath a fought opponent. Like all simple advice, it sounds easy, but making it work in practice takes discipline. Actively seek to off balance at every opportunity until it‚Äôs a habit!
"
"Watching Jiu jitsu: Whenever my students are injured I usually encourage them to come in periodically and watch classes from the sideline. Why? When you can‚Äôt train your body - train your MIND. Remember always that the mind governs our actions. You want a faster game in JiuJitsu? That will require a mind that can process options faster just as much as a faster body. The problem is that when most people watch Jiu jitsu they FOLLOW the action rather than try to JUDGE and ANTICIPATE the action. They look only at the RESULT  rather than the PROCESSES that brought about the results. When you watch, picture yourself out there and ask yourself second by second what you would be doing in their stead. How you would respond to other fellows attacks and defenses. Get engaged when you watch. The mental workout is every bit as useful and productive as the physical one the athletes on the mat are having.
"
"The positional core of Jiu jitsu is the task of getting to the mount or rear mount position: Jiu jitsu is a complex game with a great many moves. Underneath that complexity however, is a very simple desiderata - GET TO THE MOUNT OR REAR MOUNT POSITION. The mount and rear mount are the two highest scoring moves in Jiu jitsu for a reason - no other positions offer such an imbalance of attacking potential of the athlete holding these positions versus the athlete defending them. As such they represent the philosophical core of the sport - to attain a position where you can reliably attack an opponent with far greater effect than he can attack you. All of the takedowns, sweeps, passes and lesser pins are just a means to the ends of mount and rear mount. You don‚Äôt need mount or rear mount to submit people, but they are damn good positions to do so, so they fit in well with a submission specialist‚Äôs game as well as they do a positional player; and of course, when you simply can‚Äôt get an opponent to tap - you‚Äôll need a positional game to win the day. Make sure your positional game has a goal - and remember always that the entire rules, point structure and philosophy of Jiu jitsu is to make the mount and the back the goal - make your training and your mentality line up with this and your game will always be in the spirit of Jiu jitsu
"
"When it comes to developing your offensive moves in Jiu jitsu more is not better. Whichever you select, you will have to develop them over years through trial and error and experimentation. They, perhaps more than anything else will define who you are as a Jiu jitsu athlete. Remember always that you will be judged not by how many you know, but by how good you are at those you have chosen. Understand that true expertise in a few is far better than mediocrity in many.

"
"Vary your intensity: Your first day sparring in Jiu jitsu was probably pretty similar to mine and everyone else reading this post - you locked up with your opponent and gave everything you had at maximum power until you quickly exhausted yourself and got finished. The path towards expertise is largely bound up with PACE and INTENSITY. It doesn‚Äôt matter how well conditioned you are - if you go at maximum intensity for a length of time, you will get exhausted. The key is to understand that high intensity is only required for brief periods in Jiu jitsu, usually when either attacking or defending a potential score or submission. This is only a tiny fraction of the total time of any given match. The rest of the time you should be a state of relatively relaxed, but alert, calm. Learning to cycle between long stretches of calm and short bursts of high intensity effort is a huge part of your development and is the true key to endurance on the mat. The better you get at this skill, the longer you can train and the fewer injuries you will suffer. In addition your sparring will become a lot more enjoyable as a side benefit. If you have a hard time playing calm, make a note to stop in certain positions where you feel you can recharge and compose yourself, then as you improve, stretch those positions out more and employ more positions. Make it your goal to spend 70-80% of a match in a fairly calm state so you can save yourself for the 5-10% where the match is won and lost.
"
"In a world of many options, focus on the scenarios: When it comes to selecting techniques, Jiu jitsu offers far more choices than you can realistically master in a life time. Your task isn‚Äôt to master them all but rather to select a few and spend your Jiu jitsu career mastering those. This begs the question - OK if I‚Äôm supposed to learn and master a smaller number of techniques and largely ignore the rest, which ones should I focus on? To a large degree this will be answered organically over time. Your body type and personality will tend to favor certain moves and create an aversion to others. Over time you will invest in those you favor and they will be the bedrock of your game. Your coach will influence your selection also. Every coach has their own philosophy of Jiu jitsu and tends to push that in their teaching and naturally the students tend to think and act upon similar lines to the doctrines they are exposed to daily. You can go beyond this however and start asking yourself what general scenarios always seem to emerge in a given skill area and which need to be covered. For example, in guard passing the basic choice is between standing and kneeling passes. Whichever passes you decide to incorporate into your game, make sure that they cover both standing and kneeling methods. Don‚Äôt select only kneeling or only standing methods - you need to cover both scenarios. Go further, you need some passes that work through pressure/weight and some that work through movement/positioning. Make sure you have a solid representative for both approaches. It‚Äôs good to focus on the moves that come naturally to you, but make damn sure that they cover the main scenarios the sport presents in that domain, otherwise you will be left with an incomplete skill set that a good opponent can take advantage of.
"
"Get a good start through grip: Projects that begin well are generally easier to keep doing well. In Jiu jitsu everything begins with grip. Getting a superior grip at the outset whilst denying your opponent an effective grip is among the best predictors of who will dominate the exchange overall in the sport. At world championship level everyone is a good grip fighter - anyone who isn‚Äôt has been eliminated long ago. Because grip skills are not sexy and exciting to look at, most people ignore them. Then when you go with a talented opponent and you realize that you can‚Äôt even begin to get your moves to work because he easily out grips you at the onset of every exchange you realize your mistake. Most of the signature skills of world champions are optional - you can be a champion without them - but I‚Äôve never met a champion who wasn‚Äôt an outstanding gripper. Make sure you study grip set ups for all your favorite moves - the better the opponents you have to face, the more you‚Äôll need them. Here I work some basic grip concepts with Nicky Ryan prior to a bout.
"
"Distance: one of the most important determinants of your actions towards an opponent when working from guard position is DISTANCE. Whichever attacks you choose to use against your opponent will have to figure in distance as the main factor in your choice. Some attacks are well suited to an opponent at long range, some at medium and some at very close range. It‚Äôs crucial that you have attacks for every range. I would rather have only three attacks from open guard but one for each of long, medium and close range; than have nine attacks at only one of these three ranges.
"
"The two greats flaws of ashi garami: No position has had more radical influence and effect on the no gi Jiu jitsu game over the last decade than the many variations of ashi garami (a generic term denoting ‚Äúentangled legs‚Äù of which many varieties can be employed). Most of the effect over this time has come from the leg locking techniques showcased by the squad and those who followed their example. However impressive this development has been to observe, It is important always to consider not just the strengths of every weapon you employ - but also it‚Äôs weaknesses. In the case of the various ashi garami variations the two great weakness are mutual foot exposure and back exposure. Every form of leg entanglement to some degree - some more than others - will expose your feet and your back to an opponent. Usually the less they expose your feet - the more they will expose your back - and the less they expose your back - the more they will expose your feet. As such it is a weapon stands in contrast to the strongest attacking positions of Jiu jitsu such as rear mount - where you can attack with near impunity and focus entirely upon your attack with little to no regard for counter offense. Understanding this must make you circumspect when engaging in offense with ashi garami, and optimistic when engaging in defense - since at any moment you can counter attack very strongly at the feet or back if you play intelligently.
"
"Hands: Whenever you are working for the major upper body body submissions - be aware that in the majority of cases, YOUR OPPONENTS FIRST DEFENSIVE MOVE WILL BE WITH HIS HANDS/ARMS. As such, IT IS PRUDENT TO BEGIN MOST UPPER BODY SUBMISSION ATTACKS WITH A DELIBERATE ATTEMPT TO TAKE OUT YOUR OPPONENTS ABILITY TO USE HIS HANDS DEFENSIVELY PRIOR TO COMPLETING THE SUBMISSION. It‚Äôs a simple but important concept - DOMINATE THE HANDS AND YOU WILL USUALLY DOMINATE THE SUBMISSION OVERALL. Don‚Äôt get tunnel vision on the submission. Remember that a skilled opponent will resist your attempt as soon as he identifies the danger. Take out the first defensive apparatus he can use and you will be a step ahead as you battle for completion.
"
"The outcome of a match is almost entirely settled before either athlete steps on the mat. It is determined by the long hours of effort, frustration, disappointment, sweat and occasional small daily victories set among many defeats seen by only a few in the quiet of a gym whose walls tell no tales. While fate sometimes throws in some surprises and upsets, in the vast majority of cases, the stage is just a public manifestation of what has already been decided long before in countless unseen matches against nameless opponents. Therefore the course of your career is determined much more by what happens out of sight than what is seen in your most dramatic moments onstage. If you seek the highest levels - learn to love training more than anything else, because more than anything else, that will be the determinant of how high you fly

"Aussies on the loose!! I am always impressed by the degree to which jiu jitsu students devote themselves to the sport. Many travel vast distances to train - none more so than the Aussies who have to traverse thousands of miles to come to Texas and train with us. In class today the Aussies were in force! My first great student Georges St Pierre used to come by bus from Montreal to New York every weekend when he was starting out - these crazy guys went even further and crossed the Pacific Ocean!! I was extremely impressed by the degree to which Jiu jitsu has grown and developed in Australia when I was there recently - I‚Äôm not surprised given the dedication I see with these traveling Aussies! A big hello from to the jiu jitsu players working out under the Southern Cross in Australia and New Zealand - keep up the good work - you guys always punched way above your weight division in every sport - jiu jitsu will be no exception! üá¶üá∫üá≥üáø

"Roger Gracie and Lex Fridman: The great Roger Gracie @rogergracie filmed a podcast here in Austin with Lex Fridman, @lexfridman one of the worlds foremost podcasters. I talked to both of them today and it sounds like a really great interview! Great questioner with a truly outstanding guest in an interview that will provide insight for many years. Lex asked Roger about both technical and psychological aspects of Rogers approach to competitive jiu jitsu - his preference for mounted pins over other control positions and then a fascinating discussion of his legendary second match with arch rival Buchecha and using that as a vehicle to express Rogers thoughts of confidence and focus. They also discuss Rogers disdain for tactics and strategy and the path to technical mastery that defined his career. I can‚Äôt wait to see this! Lex is editing now and tells me it will be out in a couple of weeks!! And yes - they also discuss bears vs lions!! I think that question will be asked in every Lex Fridman podcast from now on üòÇüòÇ

"Great night of grappling in Austin! @enigmajiujitsuofficial held another great night of grappling action tonight here in Austin with many of the New Wave and RGA Austin students competing. Among many memorable matches for our team some of the standouts were wins for teenager Landon Elmore @landonelmorebjj who won via heel hook against an equally talented young rival Nathan Gerrard. Another of our talented teenage students Adam DeGraff @andrewdegraffmagic won via heel hook against talented rival Jacob Norton. Abraham La Montagne @abraham_the_mountain took on B team‚Äôs very athletic Sterling Mellman and won via toe hold. In the main events section, young Reese LaFever @reeseis_bjj took on B team standout Bobby Sandhu and won via heel hook. Then Helena Crevar, the outstanding teenage blue belt, took on impressive B team adult brown belt Diana Rooney and won via heel hook. In the co-main event Luke Griffith @luke_griffithjj took on Pat Shahgholi from 10th Planet and won via rear strangle. In the main event Oliver Taza @tazagarami had an epic forty minute war double overtime ADCC match against the very tough and talented 10th Planet athlete Andy Varela - Oliver prevailed showing great skill and heart to win. Great stuff from the whole team and showing how much progress they are making in such a short time. It was great to see so many local people coming out to compete and watch - grappling is really taking off here in Austin! Thank you to Enigma Grappling for giving our students a venue to showcase their growing skills!

"It all starts with one move you have trust in: For every given scenario in Jiu jitsu, bottom mount, bottom half guard, top side control, standing position takedown offense etc etc you can‚Äôt really be effective until you develop at least one move that you have strong confidence that you can successfully apply on someone your own size and skill level. One move in which you have real skill and confidence is worth far more than a dozen moves that you don‚Äôt believe you can apply against a tough opponent. Finding that first move for all the major scenarios in the game is a big part of your initial progress. Of course as you gain in expertise you‚Äôll need more than one big move, but you‚Äôve got to start somewhere. Which one you choose will be mostly determined by three things, your coaching influences, your body type and your personality. I always suggest to select from the most well known and high percentage techniques of the sport first rather than something exotic or trendy - yiu can always build that into your game later. There are ten thousand moves out there - but you need to start with a small set of trusted moves - at least one per major position/scenario of the sport. Once you find them they become your weapons that you carry into battle every time you step on the mat!
"
"Tension: Probably the single biggest issue for most beginning students in sparring is exhaustion. It‚Äôs natural to get very tense and stay at near maximum exertion level throughout the match. This will quickly exhaust anyone - even people who are in very good physical condition. Maximum isometric tension is physically exhausting. The key to endurance in sparring is learning to regulate its use. There will be times when you really need near maximum isometric strength, but these times are short and far between. For most of the match you need movement - which is best done in a state of relative relaxation. Only when you go to apply a move against resistance do you need a quick burst of isometric strength. Learn to stay relaxed most of the time and then to turn on tension when needed and most important - when to turn it off - and you will immediately find that you can grapple for longer periods of time without total exhaustion. Here, Luke Griffith is on the point of completing a stranglehold - this is the time for near maximal commitment to isometric tension - but understand that this is the exception rather than the rule. For most of your match time, stay fairly relaxed to save strength for the times you need it, and if you don‚Äôt get a speedy breakthrough - turn it off and go back to relaxation - you‚Äôll need it again later
"
"Whatever your weight is - make sure your opponent feels every ounce of it: We typically think of weight and top pressure as the methodology of bigger athletes, but in truth, everyone, even the lightest, should do their best to use their bodyweight constructively to tire and immobilize opponents. The most important elements in your success or failure in this regard will be the robustness of your connection to the opponent, the placement/positioning of your body relative to your opponent and the duration of the pressure you create. This means you‚Äôll need a solid grip, your weight positioned on a part of your opponent‚Äôs body that is ill suited to carry bodyweight (for example, his head) and riding skill to stay there long enough to cause fatigue. If you can get these elements in place you‚Äôll make an opponent regret being underneath you regardless of your size and weight!
"
"Always look to create a viable threat to your opponent whenever possible: One of the biggest determinants of how your opponent will behave in a match overall, and at a critical juncture of a match in particular, is his THREAT ASSESSMENT of you. If he doesn‚Äôt find you threatening at all, he will confidently attempt his moves. If on the other hand, he is strongly intimidated by you, he will be very reticent to attempt any but his absolute best moves and only when he feels it is safe to do so. Your opponents willingness to move is a direct reflection of the level of threat he feels. Note how Georges St Pierre immediately threatens a strangle when he gets behind Gordon Ryan. Even if the threat isn‚Äôt particularly strong, it will keep an opponent honest and force him to restrict his hands to a passive, defensive role. Most of those defensive roles are very predictable, which means you will have the tactical advantage in an ensuing hand fight. Always seek to create a level of threat that gets your opponents attention - without it he will move much more freely and prove to be a more difficult adversary
"
"If you can break an opponents stance/balance, then everything else gets easier. If you can‚Äôt, even the smallest actions will always be a struggle. Most of this game is the battle to break an opponents stance whilst preserving your own - everything else follows from this.
"
"Your mind may be your most powerful weapon - but your legs are a close second: The entire philosophy of Jiu jitsu bottom game is based on the idea that BOTTOM POSITION IS ONLY DISADVANTAGEOUS IF YOU CAN‚ÄôT USE YOUR LEGS TO GRAPPLE YOUR OPPONENT. The whole game from bottom is to keep your legs between you and your opponent and to use them as your primary weapon. Here I work with a classic tripod sweep - a fine example of using the legs to engage an opponent standing over you. Remember that even though your legs are the power source behind the guard, it is your FEET that connect that power to an opponent - so make your feet grip your opponent with the same dexterity as your hands. This is a skill that takes time to develop but will be a key element in making your legs the basis of your bottom game.

"Counting down: Gordon Ryan, Brazilian super star Nicholas Meregali and talented South African up and comer Luke Griffith weighed in for their matches against very tough opponents tomorrow night here in Dallas, Texas. The main event event between Gordon and Jacob Couch came on very short notice and so will have an X factor to it that should be very interesting. Mr Meregali has begun the journey of taking his world class jiu jitsu into the no gi game so it will be fascinating to watch him in a very new environment. Luke Griffith goes up against a physically powerful champion black belt - but this purple belt phenom from Africa has greatly impressed us with his focus and skill development and is excited to show how far he has come in a short time. Tonight we will work out and then it stage time time tomorrow night üòú

"Plotting your next move: One of the most useful abilities to develop in Jiu jitsu is that of temporarily STOPPING THE ACTION and taking a short break. This gives you the ability to PLOT THE NEXT MOVE. It can be difficult to make constructive progress if you‚Äôre just always in high gear hustling after a opponent. You can burn a lot of energy and have nothing to show for it. Often you do better by using a pattern where you apply a short intense burst of energy to attain a position that allows you to take a short breather whilst exercising sufficient control to retain that position, then figuring out your next stop, working hard to attain that new resting point and continuing this pattern until the job is done. If your hearts racing and lungs burning, keep working to get a holding position and then take a break. While you and your opponent take a short reprieve your body rests but your mind is still working - figuring out the next pit stop - and then going back to physical work. Work like this and you can grapple a long time and make consistent forward progress
"
"Gordon Ryan ADCC 2022: The greatest event in grappling history is over. New stars emerged, established stars shone bright again, but one man stood above all like a colossus - Gordon Ryan. I have seen many incredible feats of grappling, but I never saw a performance like this. For many, Mr Ryan is a polarizing figure in the sport, for many others an inspiration to look up to, but after this weekend there was no disagreement among haters and fans about his merit - He is the best ever. It was a long and difficult journey to ADCC 2022. Just one year ago we were having a difficult conversation about whether he could even continue in in the sport due to a debilitating stomach ailment. We barely had training partners and many sessions had to be abandoned soon after starting when extreme nausea from his stomach flared up. Over time he clawed his way back to a level where could train acceptably well and began to plot his return. It began with exhibition matches to get used to performing on stage again. Then he formulated an ambitious plan  to run three back to back events, a return match against current champion Pedro Merinho, a rematch against past nemesis, Felipe Pena and then ADCC itself. On the surface it was a crazy plan because the three matches had totally different rule sets and the training would require a continuous sixteen weeks of training for three rule sets against the best of the best. At one point Mr Ryan was doing thirty minute sparring rounds daily in preparation for no time limit match and then a couple of weeks later multiple ten minute ADCC wrestling rounds - it was brutal. He went through it all and emerged as the undisputed best of all time. It was a virtuoso performance of unmatched technique, preparation and confidence. No one else can claim credit for his achievement - this was his and his alone. No one else today brings together technical depth, tactical insight and the confidence to use them onstage as he does. I had many students, but I had only one Gordon Ryan.
"
"Awareness: When we think of awareness in Jiu jitsu we usually think of awareness of our defensive responsibilities and our attacking opportunities. These certainly are the most important types of awareness in the sport. There is another type of awareness however, that never gets discussed. This is MAT AWARENESS. This is the awareness of where you are positioned on a crowded mat. It is this type of awareness that makes you a safe training partner on a crowded mat. It‚Äôs easy to get so focused on your opponents that you lose track of where you are and start crashing into other people or accidentally kicking or elbowing them. When you have a room full of people who have food mat awareness everything runs smoothly. When you have a room full of people with no mat awareness it‚Äôs a disaster. Not only does mat awareness have value for safety, it also has a deeper self defense value. In a real fight you must be cognizant of your immediate surroundings and people or objects around you, because they can play a crucial role in what happens. Avoiding tunnel vision and having a good sense of what‚Äôs going on around you is an essential self defense skill that you can practice every day on the mat by making yourself conscious of the people and movements around you as you grapple. Train yourself to be able to follow conversations of the people on the sideline, what positions the people next to you are in, where you can expect them to be ten seconds from now based on their current movements. This kind of mental training will make you safer on the mat AND on the street
"
"Don‚Äôt stand in front of danger: If someone motioned towards you in a way that conveyed that they intended you throw hard punches at your head - would you stand in place directly in front of them? Of course not, you‚Äôd immediately shift off to one side and keep doing so every time they recentered in order to gain some safety. Same thing when you face the danger of a talented opponents legs as you are confronted by his guard. His guard can be as dangerous as punches, and similarly you want to angle off to a side to lessen the danger rather than stand directly in front where the will face the full array of his attacks. Make it a habit - don‚Äôt stand directly in front - GET A GRIP AND STEP TO AN ANGLE. Do it early and do it every time and you‚Äôll be a lot safer when confronted by a dangerous guard
"
"Good things happen when you work outside your opponents elbows: Frontal attacks can work well when you‚Äôre bigger or faster than your opponent or have excellent set ups to catch him by surprise, but blasting straight through the front door is tough on someone bigger and stronger or who knows what the set ups to your main attacks are. Everything gets easier when you get an angle outside your opponents elbows and work from the flanks. You suddenly find that you are fighting only half of your opponent instead of all of him; that he has to adjust his position to alleviate his angular disadvantage, leaving him momentarily vulnerable as he shifts. You can greatly increase your effectiveness just by consistently seeking to get outside your opponents elbows prior to attacking. It COSTS very little in energy and resources to do; but it can SAVE you huge amounts of energy and resources when launching and completing your attacks - make it a habit!!
"
"What does it really mean to say you should attack 100% of the human body? The ideal of Jiu jitsu is to be able to attack specific and vulnerable parts of an opponents whole body with our whole body. In this regard most people think in terms of upper body and lower body. In the last decade Jiu jitsu has made remarkable progress in lower body attacks (a traditional weak area). However, in order to really attack the whole body you need to go further than just thinking in terms of upper body lower body. For the purposes of submission attacks the human body is best divided three ways 
1 - upper body/lower body
2 - left side/right side
3 - front side/back side
  In addition the means of attack - submission holds - can be divided into joint locks and strangles. So if we are to maximize our attacking versatility - and this should be the goal of all of us if we are to call ourselves submission specialists - then we ought to be able to attack upper body and lower body, left side and right side, from both front and back, with both strangle holds (where appropriate) and joint locks. THAT will allow you to cover all the possible ways in which submissions can be employed against an opponent. You don‚Äôt need to know a lot of submissions to do this, but you DO need to know how to cover the whole of an opponents body with them if you are to reliably break through against the toughest opponents. Widen your perspective with this understanding of what it really means to attack the whole body and soon you‚Äôll widen your submission arsenal in ways that improve your performance

"I am very pleased to announce the release of my latest instructional video with @bjj.fanatics Thos is the third and final instructional in the STANDING2GROUND series which features jiu jitsu standing position and takedown skills. This third volume covers UPPER BODY TAKEDOWNS which featured so prominently in the award winning performances of my students in the ADCC 2022 World Championships. Upper body takedowns have several notable advantages in Jiu Jitsu competition - they largely avoid the danger of upper body submissions as you attempt takedowns and offer much better probability of scoring after the takedown due to tight upper body connection in the critical aftermath of a takedown attempt. My students made upper body takedowns the basis of their standing game and had great success with it - perhaps you can too!! Link in my Instagram bio

"Victory in Dallas!! Rory MacDonald @romac_gorilla won a brilliant victory in his MMA fight tonight against the very tough and experienced Brett Cooper. He was able to mix his formidable striking and grappling skills into a flawless package to flow from punching combinations into takedown into beautiful pin transitions into devastating grapple boxing (the skill of mixing striking and grappling) culminating in a picture perfect strangle finish mid way through the first round. Watching Firas run Rory through the warm up brought back many memories of past campaigns, but on stage Rory showed he has not been dwelling in the past as he showed recent improvements in his grappling skills. As always there are many people to thank. Thank you to @firas_zahabi for being such an amazing friend, coach and student and guiding Rory‚Äôs development for so long. Thank you @timkennedymma and friends for high level sparring rounds. Thank you @roka for giving us such a great training facility for the fight camp over last six weeks.

"When you can get the upper body and the lower body facing in opposite directions, you will generally dominate the top passing, pinning and pressure game. The two most powerful means of controlling the human body are the head and hips. If you can control both AND make them face in opposite directions, you truly put an opponent under pressure and he will find it very difficult indeed to stop you advancing to your next objective.

"Gravity: We tend to think of gravity as our friend when we are on top and our enemy when we‚Äôre on bottom - but if you play things right gravity can be a trusted friend when playing from bottom too. The method is to disturb your opponents balance. If you can do this, gravity will stumble your oops and force him to base out to recover - and that will create a temporary break in stance that enables you to penetrate the toughest defenses and get the breakthrough you seek. If you make gravity your friend only when your on top you‚Äôll miss a thousand opportunities to win - learn to attack your opponents balance and gravity will be your friend wherever you are.
"
"First contact: Every time you start the process of engaging an opponent the ability of both of you to attack each other increases as you get CLOSER and you establish greater and greater GRIPS upon each other.  So distance and grip determine the initial relative danger you pose to each other. As distance gets closer other factors such as angle and level become very important - but distance comes first. As such, your approach must begin with STANCE. Set a stance that doesn‚Äôt make you an easy target. With regards GRIP - one sound way to work is to START AT THE EXTREMITIES - the hands. Tie up at the hands to shut down your opponents ability to grip and work from there to your own grips. Thus you begin with nullifying your opponents ability to grip and attack, and then move on to setting up your offense by imposing your own grips on your terms. Learning to be disciplined about this throughout the entire course a match is very important. Many athletes START OUT doing this, but get forgetful as the match progress and get scores on as a result. Making it an ingrained habit takes time, but will make you a much more effective grappler - one who is difficult to score on and whose chances of victory increase as a match goes on rather than decrease.

It is a superb example of how judo skills can be modified to no gi and play a very positive role in a jiu jitsu match. The upper body connection negates the threat of submissions above the waist and ensures that after the throw even a very talented scrambler like Mr Ruotolo will have a very difficult time trying to recover and get back up to his feet. Uchi mata excels as both a defensive throw against leg tackles and as in this case, an offensive throw in its own right. Note the initial push with ouchi gari to get the opponent pushing into him and then the change in direction to create a very clean finish.

"Got a good position? Get a better one! Don‚Äôt be satisfied with good when great is readily available. There are lots of good positions out there, but only a few great ones. Very often the transition from good to great is quite easy. Here, Garry Tonon has a good position - front head lock - but you can see his mind is plotting for better - the back! Nothings beats getting behind an opponent. Next time you‚Äôre doing well, ask yourself if you could be doing still better - usually the answer the yes. Don‚Äôt hesitate - take that next step and turn good into great

"The rising star of grappling shows Who‚Äôs Number One run by @flograppling in Austin, Texas is on May 28! Australian superstar Craig Jones will replace Gordon Ryan in the main event. Sadly Gordon‚Äôs long battle with a protracted stomach illness is not going well and he will have to step out of the competition circuit until it is satisfactorily resolved. Craig Jones stepped in on short notice to replace him. He has a very tough and dangerous opponent - the great world champion Luiz Panza - a master of leg locks who also excels at upper body submissions and has a great positional game as well. This will be a fascinating contrast in leg locking style. Mr Panza has devastating Achilles locks with a more traditional Jiu jitsu style - both straight and cross. Mr Jones has a more modern style focused around twisting locks and a systematic control game based around multiple ashi garami variations. One thing is certain - if either one gets a decisive grip on the leg - it‚Äôs over! Squad juniors Nicky Ryan and Oliver Taza take on very impressive opponent. Mr Ryan will face black belt standout Gabriel Almeida, who has world class Jiu jitsu and also excellent wrestling skills along with a big size advantage over Mr Ryan. Mr Taza will take on the brilliant AOJ athlete Johnatha Alves. Mr Alves has a very polished and refined game with beautiful positional transitions. There are many other great matches on the card, including brilliant American world champion Michael Musumici! Two of the toughest grapplers in the game, Vagner Rocha of Fight Sports and Josh Hinger of ATOS will clash in what will be a very hard fought match. Mr Hinger has an exceptionally dangerous guillotine but Mr Rocha has proven extremely resistant to even the best submission hunters and has an incredible ability to endure attacks, wear an opponent down get to victory - this should be a really great match. Talented AOJ athlete Jessa Khan takes on Pati Fontes. Both of these stand out athletes are really committing to the no gi game and this match will help them on their path to the top of the women‚Äôs division. I think Mica Galvao vs Andrew Tackett may be the match to watch! Hope you all enjoy the show!

"Physiologically there is little to tell apart fear and excitement. They create similar outward effects - sweat, shallow breathing, adrenal response etc - but internally they feel totally different. One will invigorate you, the other will paralyze you. They are very close physically but diametrically opposed mentally. Learning to transform fear into excitement is one of the great keys to performance. Some people seem to do it effortlessly, for others it‚Äôs a real struggle. It‚Äôs not fatal if you can‚Äôt, I‚Äôve seen great athletes perform at the highest levels while afflicted with fear, but it is more difficult for them than for those who seem to relish the stage and see it only as inducing excitement without fear
"
"Good jiu jitsu players create PROBLEMS for their opponents; GREAT jiu jitsu players create DILEMMAS: Every problem has a solution. Dilemmas are different. They don‚Äôt have a solution, only two bad outcomes that force you to choose the least damaging one. Observe this photo of Gordon Ryan passing half guard - it‚Äôs an excellent example of a simple but powerful expression of creating dilemmas from which there is no good outcome for your opponent. He has freed the knee of his his left leg. This enables him to drive his knee across his opponents far hip towards a mounted position (it won‚Äôt yet be a true mount because his foot is still trapped, but it‚Äôs getting close). His opponent recognizes the danger and reaches to stop the knee with his hand. This is what Mr Ryan is looking for. By reaching for the knee the opponent has created a big opening for a far side underhook that will enable Mr Ryan to go into several very strong passing positions; If he DOESN‚ÄôT reach for the knee, Mr Ryan will simply drive the knee across the hip towards the mounted position and take even stronger passing positions - either way it‚Äôs bad for the opponent. This is the kind of game you want to play whenever possible in jiu jitsu. You can‚Äôt always do it - but you‚Äôll be pleasantly surprised how often you can if you teach yourself to look for it. Why settle for creating a problem that talented opponents will find a solution for when instead you can create a dilemma for which there is no solution?

"Lex Fridman podcast: While in Austin I had the opportunity to have a fascinating conversation with the brilliant Artificial Intelligence researcher, Lex Fridman. In addition to his outstanding work in AI, Mr Fridman is an avid practitioner of Jiu jitsu and combat sports. He asked many extremely interesting and insightful questions about Jiu jitsu and life with some of the most important being those that came from his unique perspective in AI research and robotics and how this pertains to training in JiuJitsu. I‚Äôm not certain when it will be released but I believe it will be some time early next week - if you‚Äôre interested I am sure @lexfridman will notify it‚Äôs release. Squad juniors Nicky Ryan and Ethan Crelinsten both had very tough matches against excellent opponents last night. Mr Ryan won a very close victory against PJ Barch in a match that pitted Mr Barch‚Äôs excellent D1 wrestling skills vs Mr Ryan‚Äôs ability to scrimmage up from guard position to his takedowns. Mr Crelinsten lost to the extremely talented Cade Ruatolo who showed excellent pace control and a beautifully applied Darce strangle to take a fine victory. Now it‚Äôs off to Boston to film an upcoming video as part of the NEW WAVE JIU JITSU series and then back to Puerto Rico to get everyone ready for future events - thank you to Mr Fridman for a fascinating conversation!

"The basis of an opponents defense will always be his STANCE. It stands to reason therefore, that if you want to be successful with your attacks, BEGIN BY ATTACKING AND BREAKING HIS STANCE and only then go into the attack itself. Attacking a fortified defensive defensive position is dangerous and costly work - attacking a position whose defensive walls have been broken down is easy. Begin every attack with an attack on the opponents stance and your Jiu jitsu will go to a higher level.
"
"A path in the wilderness: Jiu jitsu sparring can seem like a confusing mess as you get twisted upside down, left, right and every which way. The add to that the thousands of different options you could use, but every time the thought of applying one of them occurs to you the situation changes so rapidly that now the opportunity is gone and you‚Äôve to choose again. This is why it‚Äôs so important to have a small set of major or favorite moves (tokui-waza). When everything seems confused, they bring order back into the picture. If you know where you need to be in order to execute a move that you really believe can win it for you - you‚Äôll find a way to get there. As a light house guides a ship in the darkness, so too, a move that you understand well and have faith in will guide you towards it no matter how confused your situation in a match.

"Most athletes aspire to BELIEVE they will win before going in to a match. The best athletes don‚Äôt believe they‚Äôll win - they KNOW they‚Äôre going to win. But what happens when you have two athletes who both ‚ÄúKNOW‚Äù they‚Äôre going to win prior to the match? Well, that‚Äôs when shit gets interesting‚Ä¶
"
"Relaxed tension: Jiu jitsu is a physical game. People often pontificate about how size and strength don‚Äôt matter and it‚Äôs all about pure leverage etc etc. The fact is, you‚Äôll need a lot of exertion to enter into and complete effective moves on a skilled opponent. We all have a tendency to go all in on exertion to a point where it becomes very counterproductive. The key is being able to manage tension appropriately. You don‚Äôt want to be a rag doll - you‚Äôll never beat anyone that way. Nor do you want to be under continuous maximal tension, you‚Äôll quickly get exhausted after a strong start and lose as time passes. The best athletes discern when they can lower tension to a level appropriate to the second by second situation they find themselves in. They also put a cap on how long they‚Äôll allow themselves to take their engine to the redline - too long and you‚Äôll overheat. The best visual guide to tension is the face. If your face is contorted with exertion for long periods of time and in situations where nothing is happening - something is wrong. The best athletes have a zen like calm to their face for the vast majority of the match - even in situations that are pretty intense. They reserve their redline energy for the few times it‚Äôs really needed in a match  try hard to follow this example. It can be difficult when starting but it‚Äôs very important for your long term development
"
"Pressure: The single greatest determinant of victory or defeat in grappling is the ability (or lack of) to apply PRESSURE OVER TIME on an opponent. Remember always that the opponent you face in the first minute of a match is not the same person as you face in the tenth minute of that match. Pressure wears us down, makes us poor decision makers, makes us settle for acceptable outcomes rather than optimal, makes us incapable or unwilling to perform moves we are capable of. The more pressure you impose upon an opponent the more dramatic will be the degrading of the opponents abilities over time. The skill of pressure fighting is to be able to CONSTANTLY KEEP YOUR OPPONENTS WORK RATE HIGHER THAN YOUR OWN OVER TIME AND ULTIMATELY HIGHER THAN WHAT HE IS CAPABLE OF SUSTAINING FOR THAT LENGTH OF TIME, WHILE KEEPING YOUR OWN WORK RATE WITHIN ACCEPTABLE LIMITS. Learning and expanding your repertoire of techniques is your first goal in Jiu jitsu but as you progress you will find it becomes more and more about the ability to take what you‚Äôve learned and apply it with pressure over time.
"
"Attacking through 360 degrees: When we practice most of our favorite submissions we typically do so in the standard, most comfortable and controlling positions and orientations. Then in sparring and competitions we find that opponents defend by twisting and turning in ways you never anticipated and you have to try to finish in orientations you rarely, if ever, practice in. Unsurprisingly the lack of familiarity with these contorted position means the submissions fail. YOU MUST BE ABLE TO SUSTAIN AN ATTACK COMFORTABLY AND EFFECTIVELY THROUGH 360 DEGREES OF ROTATION AND IN ALL THE RESULTING UNCOMFORTABLE AND UNFAMILIAR ORIENTATIONS THAN CAN ARISE. Only then can you hope to use your favorite submissions against strong resistance. Practice having training partners rotate out of your holds and rotate with them whilst holding the lock tight enough that you could apply the lock at any point in the rotation if you wanted. Go through multiple rotations and be tight enough at the end to apply a finishing hold. Here, Nicky Ryan has an opponent turn through a triangle and is ready to either follow the movement or switch to another form of triangle - this is the kind of skill that enables you to get the breakthrough against serious resistance
"
"Failure vs potential: When we look at our performance in Jiu jitsu we tend to lump everything into two categories - success and failure. Moves either work or they don‚Äôt - they succeed or fail. If you adopt this mindset there is little chance that you will make technical progress over time. The reason is simple - whenever we learn new moves it is almost certain that the vast majority of applications when we start out will fail. When we first learn a move our performance of it is usually ( and understandably) poor. It takes time to build skill. It will take time for you to take a move from infancy to adulthood. A much better approach is to asses moves not by success or failure, but by potential. The best indicator of general potential is usually not from you, but comes from watching high level athletes performing the move in top level competition. If the move works repeatedly there then it‚Äôs likely it will work at whatever level you are. Then start asking if it has specific potential for YOU. As yourself if it works for a wide array of body types and levels of athleticism. If it requires such extreme athletic abilities that only a handful of people can apply well, it may not have potential for you. Then start your personal journey with the move. Start small. Don‚Äôt try it first with the toughest guy in your gym. Try it on lesser targets until you feel ready to move up. When you first try it you will soon get a sense of whether the move feels natural to you. Even if it‚Äôs not fully succeeding at first of you can feel POTENTIAL - perhaps you ALMOST get it to work a couple of times, that‚Äôs a good sign that it‚Äôs worth more work and time. In time a move that almost works can become a move works really well almost every time. Success or failure isn‚Äôt the yardstick of new moves - potential is.

"Dual threats: When your Dad first showed you how to throw a punch he told you jab was good, rear cross was good, but the combination of them both - the old 1-2, was best of all. Your Dad was absolutely correct. The very same advice applies just as well to jiu jitsu. Creating one threat is good, but creating a dual threat is always better. Here I use the leg position of a triangle combined with the arm position of kimura to create a dual threat. The more an opponent defends one the more vulnerable he becomes to the other. As you gave better and better opponents, the finishes won‚Äôt come easy, and the more you will have to create dual threats to get the breakthrough you seek. Learn to match and pair your moves - they won‚Äôt be twice as effective as a single move - they‚Äôll be FOUR times as effective due to their action/reaction dynamic that is so difficult for an opponent to counter. You already know your favorite moves - now it‚Äôs time to form them into your favorite PAIRS in order to get to the next level.

"Reflections on a truly great athlete and career: The great Khabib Nurmagomedov fought another brilliant fight last night to take another dominant victory over the very dangerous Justin Gaethje. As he has so many many times, Mr Nurmagomedov was able to neutralize his opponent with superb takedowns and ground control. As with all great athletes, opponents know what to expect but are simply unable to stop it. Many people describe Mr Nurmagomedov as just a wrestler but he showed last night that he has a truly superb MMA skill set. Mr Gaethje is himself a fine wrestler, but as Georges St Pierre showed so many times, wrestling/takedowns in an MMA fight is a very different skill than wrestling/takedowns in a pure wrestling match. He integrated his striking into takedowns superbly and was able to make the takedowns look easy against an excellent wrestler. Not only that, he showed he has excellent submissions skills and the control skills to set them up with beautiful mount control leading into a superb mounted triangle (when was the last time you saw a mounted triangle used to finish an MMA fight? Forget about a UFC title fight!) The application was flawless and resulted in a quick strangle to unconsciousness (I have no idea what the referee was doing as Mr Gaethje clearly tapped twice and Mr Nurmagomedov did what he is supposed to do - hold on until the referee stops the action). Even more impressive is the fact that Mr Nurmagomedov essentially won the fight twice that night - he had total control from the mount at the end of round one and only the bell saved his opponent. Then he went out in round two and repeated the action and got back into mount and finished in spectacular style. To do this twice - once per round against such a dangerous opponent is truly admirable. Through his career this remarkable man has always conducted himself with honor and a straight forward no-nonsense attitude . He stood up for his team mates and what he believed was right and never let himself be swayed by what others wanted or demanded. What a privilege to watch such an athlete in action and see him finish an unbeaten career and forge the path he wanted on his terms.

"The better you start, the more likely you‚Äôll finish well: Jiu jitsu is like life itself, the better your starting circumstances, the better the chance that you‚Äôll finish in a good place. It‚Äôs important that you raise the probability of success by giving yourself the best possible starting position in every aspect of the game. More than anything else, This means setting yourself in a good stance at the onset of action. It doesn‚Äôt matter whether your in a neutral position, a dominant position, an inferior position, attacking with a submission hold or defending a submission hold - starting with a strong stance raises the likelihood of success. Here, I coach the keys to stance in a dreadful position, defending a fully set juji gatame arm bar. More than ever, this is a time when deficiencies in beginning stance and positioning will cost you dearly. Every time you engage an opponent, every time there is a re-set in the action, every time there is a change in position or scenario - THE FIRST CHALLENGE YOU FACE IS TO SET YOUR STANCE APPROPRIATELY. Make sure you condition your mind to operate in these terms when you grapple and you‚Äôll find your effectiveness in both offense and defense increases dramatically
"
"Escapes - testing yourself: Here is a moment when my students and I were teaching a seminar in Singapore. Much of what we went over was concerned with escapes from bad position. When it comes time to escape the mount no gi, I strongly favor the kipping escape. This is an escape that superficially looks like a push, but really it is based upon the kipping action of the legs (kipping is a movement of the legs designed to create momentum in a given direction - most commonly used when people want to cheat doing pull ups to make it easier to get up to the bar but also very useful when you want to make it easier to escape certain pins), along with misdirection of your opponents lines of resistance. All of my students excel at this move, in fact there were times early in their careers i had to tell them to stop using it so much because they were going into competitions and deliberately putting themselves in the bottom mount position so they could simply escape and heel hook unwitting opponents! Here Gordon Ryan demonstrates during the seminar. Note the ease of execution and the changes in direction as the move unfolds. In my upcoming NEW WAVE JIU JITSU - ESCAPES video I will cover this fascinating method and show its link to counter offense where you can escape directly into strong leg lock attacks so that you don‚Äôt only get out - you finish the opponent as you do so.  When you get really good you can get fancy and perform the escape with one arm as Gordon Ryan does here üòúüòú All of my students training begins with defense. Having the confidence that comes from knowing that you can escape the worst positions and counter attack is worth its weight in gold.

"Not every day in the gym will be a good one. In fact there will often be periods of weeks and even months where you feel like you‚Äôre making no progress at all. There‚Äôll be days you swear you‚Äôre going backwards. Disappointment and frustration occur more often than success in a tough room. Hang in there. Understand that everyone around you is progressing at a similar rate to you. Just as swimmers in a river current are carried at similar speeds by the river itself and so don‚Äôt see much reward for all their attempts at swimming; so too the room rises and makes everyone in it feel like their effort doesn‚Äôt make a difference. It does. You‚Äôll have a day every so often where you get to see the fruits of your work. That‚Äôs how the game works. Long periods of of tough work with apparently little progress and a few golden days randomly interspersed among them that reveal how far you‚Äôve come. It‚Äôs true that rates of improvement vary over time. It‚Äôs true that some people can make faster progress than others. It‚Äôs true that a change in training program can affect rates of progress - but I‚Äôve never seen a case where someone trained regularly and sincerely and made NO progress. Rate of progress is important, but if your goals are long term, it doesn‚Äôt matter too much whether you get to those goals a little sooner or a little later. Remember always that whatever doubts are inside your mind about your progress - the only way you won‚Äôt improve at all over time is to stop showing up.
"
"In Jiu Jitsu you can know the future: The whole method of Jiu jitsu is TO GAIN EVER INCREASING CONTROL OVER YOUR OPPONENTS MOVEMENT AND PUSH HIM INTO A MOVEMENT FUNNEL WHERE HE HAS FEWER AND FEWER OPTIONS OVER TIME UNTIL A POINT IS REACHED WHERE YOU KNOW WHAT HIS NEXT MOVES MUST BE TO ESCAPE - WHEN YOU KNOW HIS NEXT MOVE BEFORE HE PERFORMS IT - ITS VERY EASY TO APPLY YOUR CHECKMATE MOVE. This is the way of good Jiu jitsu. Take all your favorite submissions and start to research how options become limited as certain restrictions are enforced on an opponents movement. Learn to funnel everything down to one or two options. When you can see the future move before it happens and impose your restrictions and counters upon it early, Victory will be yours
"
"Top and bottom: When most people begin the sport of Jiu jitsu they almost always do better in top position than they do in bottom position. A decently athletic and competitive person can usually be reasonably effective against other white belts from top position within a fairly short time frame. Most people have a decent sense of holding another person down from on top. Bottom position however, is a very different story. Very few, if any, people come into the sport with a natural propensity for bottom game. Even very athletic people usually flop around hopelessly in bottom position when they first attempt it. It‚Äôs as though nothing in our previous experience prepares us for Jiu jitsu bottom game. Everything has to be learned from a state of total ignorance. Overcoming this common imbalance between our natural propensity for top position over bottom must be a core part of your early days in jiu jitsu. When starting out EMPHASIZE THE BOTTOM GAME MORE THAN TOP GAME. This will create great initial frustration as you are essentially handicapping yourself by forcing yourself into weakness, but the long term benefits will make it worth it. Ultimately you want to be equally strong in top and bottom position, but given the uneven start we all begin with we need to nurture bottom game development more at the beginning so that as time passes you naturally even out in development.
"
"Defense in depth: Most of you know that I put an extraordinarily high value on defense training for my students. My belief is that only when students have a strong belief in their defense will they take risks - and any offensive move entails risk - so ironically only athletes who believe in their defense will engage with their offense in high level competition. Understand always that defense comes in different forms based upon how far the opponent has entered into their move. Early defense is the most efficient. The old clock that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure is very true with regards Jiu jitsu. If you can anticipate an attack you will defend it easily. Much more challenging is late defense, where an opponent has performed the move almost to completion and you have to dig your way out. This requires knowledge, skill and a steady nerve. Learn all the aspects of defense from early to late and everything in between - but when you care about winning, be sure to prioritize early defense - it will be easier on your body and less scary for your friends observing on the sidelines! Here, Nicky Ryan shuts down the dangerous leg lock game of the great Masakazu Imanari early on to allow himself to focus on his own attacks and victory
"
"The triangle will always be among the most pure examples of the Jiu jitsu ideal of pitting your legs against your opponents upper body. Your opponent may be bigger and stronger than you overall, but his arms are not as big and strong as your legs - use this simple insight as often as you can - and nothing does it better than the triangle
"
"The power of wrestling! We had a visit today from some truly outstanding wrestlers - Jason Nolf and Geno Morelli from the Penn State program came in and deeply impressed everyone with their skill on the mats! We‚Äôve been extremely impressed in the past by Penn State wrestlers Roman Bravo Young and Dan Vallimont - that program seems to create wrestlers who adapt extremely well to Jiu jitsu. Wrestlers who exhibit a smoother, movement and set up based style (J‚Äôden Cox is a good example) seem to make the adaptation to Jiu jitsu easier than other wrestlers. It was a great experience watching them in action - Mr Nolf successfully performed his patented Dixie roll in live sparring! It‚Äôs always a pleasure to see and learn from talented visitors and they don‚Äôt get more talented than these fellows. Interestingly the general pattern for the future is towards increasing integration of wrestling with jiu jitsu rather than the silly tribal rivalry between grappling arts that was prevalent when I began. We learned a bunch of stuff today that could easily be integrated into Jiu jitsu and make it a better sport for the future

"Movement creates opportunity: The hardest times to apply submissions are on a static opponent who‚Äôs limbs are thoroughly contracted. Movement almost always provokes an opponent into extension of the limbs and an extended opponent is much easier to submit. Keep your opponent moving - if this proves difficult - move around your opponent - both will provoke an opponent into reaching and extending his limbs - and if you‚Äôve been practicing your submissions diligently - that‚Äôs all you need to attack!
"
"Anyone can train when they want to. Whether you reach your potential or not will be determined not by whether you train when you feel like training, but by how you behave when you DON‚ÄôT feel like training. The best train regardless of how they might feel that day. If you wish to get to your goals you must do the same.
"
"Fight the connection: In order to make a move a move in grappling, an opponent must begin with some form of connection - if you break that connection early on - the rest of the move will be nullified. There are many ways to break connection but in most cases the best place to start is at the end of the lever - the hands and feet. They are usually the primary connectors to the body and if they can make effective contact the move is generally lost. So when you feel danger encroaching - break that connection and then start getting into your counter offense!!
"
"Defensive responsibility: In a sport where you and an opponent simultaneously launch attacks on each other it‚Äôs crucial that you maintain defensive responsibility at all times. Don‚Äôt let this turn you into an overly conservative or timid athlete - you want to carry the spirit of attack into every match. The hardest times to be defensively responsible are Gene you‚Äôre mostly focused on attack. Most people can either attack OR defend - but the best athletes merge the two so that they‚Äôre defensively aware even as they press their attacks and ready to launch immediately into offense even as they‚Äôre fending off an opponents attacks. Anyone can think defensively when they‚Äôre defending and anyone can think offensively when they‚Äôre attacking - but the best think defensively even when they‚Äôre attacking and offensively even as they‚Äôre defending
"
"Know the strong points of each positional variation: Jiu jitsu gives you a LOT of choice. Any given position has many variations within it - each of those variations has it good points and bad points. Each presents elements that suit your body type in some ways and frustrates it in others. Take guard position for example. There are dozens of different types of guard. Each different configuration offers different connection to an opponent and hence different possibilities for attack. It is important you understand that connection and it‚Äôs ramifications for your attack choice. Take closed guard for example. It‚Äôs most important feature is that locks your hips on top of your opponents hips so that even though your body as a whole is underneath your opponents body, the most important part of your body, your hips, are on top of the most important part of your opponents body - his hips. This has important ramifications. It means that any sweep or reversal that maintains that hip connection will result in a sweep directly to mounted position  rather than merely a sweep to top position as is the case with most guard sweeps - after all, closed guard is essentially just an upside down mount position as far as body connection goes. This insight tells you that almost any form of submission you can employ from mount will be applicable from guard - the set ups will be different given the change from top to bottom - but technique selection will be the same. It means that any form of go behind that gets you around and behind your opponents arms will lead directly to rear mount. Knowing the most important feature of each given position in Jiu jitsu will give you the insights you need to direct your attacks better. Don‚Äôt just associate a position with a list of attacks - look for it‚Äôs deeper mechanical basis and you will see further than your opponents

"Quadrants of the body: When it‚Äôs time to submit an opponent your main targets are the neck (strangles), arms and legs (joint locks). Divide your opponents body into left upper quadrant (left arm target). Right upper quadrant (right arm target). Left lower quadrant (left leg target) right lower quadrant (right leg target). My favorite way to attack joint lock combinations is either side upper quadrant followed by opposite side lower body quadrant. This is the most natural (it‚Äôs always easier to go DOWN the body than UP the body for joint lock combinations on the floor) and the most deceptive (going from one side to the other takes advantage of the natural defenses to the initial upper body attack. You can see it here - I am threatening my partners right arm but positioning myself in such a way that it will be very easy to transition to the left leg (upper right to lower left) should the arm lock fail. Combining your attacks in this way will make you a very dangerous combination attacker - and get you more finishes on the mat!

"When you get an opponent off balance he will be open for attack. When you get a GOOD opponent off balance he will throw up his defenses and you will need a second attack feeding off those defenses to break through. When you take a GREAT opponent off balance he will be looking to counter attack the second after he throws up his defenses and you will need to anticipate the few counter attacking options he has from that recovery scenario and base your follow up attacks on that prior knowledge. Your BODY STARTS the attack sequence, but it‚Äôs your MIND that KEEPS you ahead against the best.
"
"Grip with four appendages - not two: When people ask me about gripping skills in Jiu jitsu they almost invariably want to talk about grip STRENGTH. Even when they talk about this they invariably refer to strength of the HANDS. Never forget that from guard position you must learn to grip with both hands AND feet. It is crucial that you develop dexterity in your feet so that they can grip and pull and push just like your hands do. The great advantage of guard position is that it UNWEIGHTS YOUR FEET so that they can be used as two extra gripping limbs. You get to fight an opponent with four of your limbs - he only gets to fight with two. Look how uber talented Australian grappler Craig Jones expertly uses all four limbs simultaneously to grip up his opponent as he closes distance. Your hands are only half the story of gripping in Jiu jitsu - only when you use all four appendages in concert will you maximize your gripping potential

"Heading up to Boston to film another jiu jitsu instructional video - back at Austin airport. It‚Äôs starting to get warm here in Texas! Hot days of summer ahead. I always loved the New England summers so I‚Äôm looking forward to to seeing the gang up in Boston. Then it‚Äôs back to Texas to get ready for some big upcoming shows! Hope you all had a good summers day!

"Two phase sweeps/reversals from open guard: When we begin the study of Jiu jitsu we are taught a classical paradigm of guard sweeps that utilizes the great power of Gi grips along with a curriculum of traditional sweeps that take us directly from bottom to top position. In competitive no gi matches however, we often have to make use of a messy, scrappy paradigm of guard sweeps that has two distinct phases in the transition from top to bottom. The first is a classic Jiu jitsu sweep that knocks an opponent down to his hands and/or hip. The inherently weaker grips of no gi grappling however, make it very difficult to control a strongly resisting opponent during and after his fall. As the opponent tries to recover from the off balancing, we go into phase two - we tackle the opponent around the legs/hips/waist to secure a much more robust no gi grip and scrimmage up into a takedown reversal. While it is not pretty to look at, this two phase approach is very realistic and effective in competitive situations where your classic sweeps just aren‚Äôt getting you the scores you need. Next time you‚Äôre sweeping without the gi - don‚Äôt complacently relax as the opponent falls - be ready to scrimmage up from bottom and finish what you started!!

"The fundamental choice in joint locks - twisting or linear: Joint locks are the second major category of submission holds (strangleholds are the first). They can be divided into linear locks and twisting locks. A good example of a linear lock would be juji gatame arm bar or a knee bar. The joint is straightened out and the breaking pressure is in a straight line. Twisting locks involve turning the joint to create a rotational breaking pressure. Both are devastating when taken to their limit, but in my experience the effects of rotational locks tend to come on quicker and have greater fight ending capability when applied in practical situations. Make sure you have at least one of each type per limb taken to a high level of development. Often as an opponent straightens a limb defensively in response to a twisting lock, you can switch to a linear lock; and, as he bends his arm to escape a linear lock, you can switch to a twisting lock. Don‚Äôt see them as rivals, but rather as complimenting partners. On their own, they‚Äôre good - working as a pair they‚Äôre great.

"Get to your grips and get to work! Everything starts with grip - if you don‚Äôt have some form of grip and connection you can do very little. When you go to grip - ENTER WITH A PLAN - don‚Äôt just go forward and see what happens. Know the grip you want and know what you want to do with it and you‚Äôll get off to a solid start in most engagements.

"The return: Tomorrow night in Austin Texas, Gordon Ryan will step out on stage again in an exhibition match against talented UFC middleweight Philip Rowe. Mr Ryan has been locked in the toughest fight of his career against a lingering and debilitating stomach illness that has over time time taken over his ability to train and prepare professionally for matches, prompting a time away from the game in an attempt to get it under control. Most of his biggest matches and victories have been fought under the shadow of this vexing problem - a testament to his ability to shrug off difficulties and focus on the win, but in the last year it has gotten to a point where daily training has been severely disrupted. He wants to stay active during this time and so exhibition matches are a good means of doing so. The rule set is actually quite interesting - almost like sparring in the gym as the two athletes will try to amass as many submissions as possible in the fifteen minutes allowed. This allows a full length match and incentivized both athletes to take submission risks as you can get a second or third chance if it backfires. Thanks as always to @flograppling and WNO for putting on great shows with interesting rule sets so that athletes can showcase their skills in what has become the premier industry event outside of the ADCC World Championships. @tazagarami and @bjjdamien will be stepping on stage against very talented opponents  among many top level Jiu jitsu stars on this great card!

"Young masters: One of the great cliches of martial arts is that old masters have vast reservoirs of knowledge that younger athletes don‚Äôt and therefore that younger athletes may be very good in competition but won‚Äôt be very good as teachers until presumably they become much older and then they become great teachers. This is complete hogwash. What counts in Jiu jitsu wisdom is not your physical age but rather your accumulated time on the mat and the quality of that time. For example, I would much rather be instructed by a twenty year old who had trained every day from an early age and who was totally immersed in the sport and studied everything from fundamentals to cutting edge material and logged an impressive fifteen thousand hours on the mats than a fifty five year old who trained once a week and who had only logged around four thousand hours of mat time. When it comes to knowledge accumulated mat time is a far more reliable indicator of knowledge than physical age. Add to that the quality of mat time - depth of study, ability to articulate that knowledge to others, degree to which experimentation and research was performed over that mat time etc - and this is what will tell you is the degree of expertise they possess, not their age. I am constantly amazed at the teaching prowess of my young students, Garry Tonon, Gordon Ryan, Craig Jones and Nicky Ryan have a depth of knowledge that would deeply impress the older generations in the sport. Remember that Sir Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein revolutionized the world with their knowledge in their early twenties - no one tried to dismiss their ideas because they were young. Martial arts are no different. There are young masters out there who have built incredible stores of knowledge that can change your game
"
"The general nature of Jiu jitsu is that of climbing the body to the hips and head: All Jiu jitsu is based on connection - no physical connection means no Jiu jitsu. The goal of Jiu jitsu is control. The best part of the body to control is the head with the hips a close second. Nonetheless is very difficult and even hazardous to attempt to start by connecting directly to the head and hips. The great pattern of Jiu jitsu is to begin with the extremities and work methodically up to the hips and then the head - like climbing - you don‚Äôt begin at the peak - you start at the base and work your way up. In Jiu jitsu you begin at the wrists and ankles and work up to the elbows and knees, from there to the waist/hips and from there to the head. Think about passing guard. Contact usually begins with your hands on an opponents ankles, then closing distance and gripping a knee, then battling forward and getting to the hips and from there battling up to chest to chest position and capturing the head to solidify the pin. This general pattern of climbing from the extremities to the waist and head is the eternal pattern of Jiu jitsu - it must become the pattern of your thinking and acting in the sport and in your training and in your mindset. Like all things in life there are rarely shortcuts to the final destination you seek - climb methodically and be prepared to start again every time you fail - your patience in observing this basic feature of Jiu jitsu will be rewarded

"How To Do Perfect Guard Retention In BJJ by @DanaherJohn

"Make them carry your weight: Gravity is a truly powerful force - make sure you use it as much as possible in your jiu jitsu. When on top and past your opponents legs, use your weight and center it over your opponents head and shoulders and within a very short period of time the hard physical work of holding that weight up will break him and make him take risks he would normally never take in order to relieve the pressure. Be ready to capitalize on those risks and unforced errors. Experiment with ways and methods of maximizing the felt pressure of your weight. You will find that getting off your knees and into tripod posture often greatly increases your felt weight and allows you to direct your weight with great precision through your head and cross face shoulder. You don‚Äôt have to BE heavy in order to FEEL heavy (though of course it helps üòú) Learn to use your weight to advantage and you‚Äôll find that even the toughest matches become easier as time passes.
"
"My first two goals when I teach open guard: Open guard is among the most difficult skills to learn in Jiu jitsu. Part of the problem is that it‚Äôs a big, interconnected skill area. If you lack skills in one area the whole project can look and feel weak. Another problem is that as you are trying to enact your guard play, your opponent is trying to enact his guard passing. As a result you have to try to impose your moves whilst simultaneously defending his. This often tends to shut developing students down as they get caught somewhere between their desire for offense and their need for defense. I found over the years most students (above blue belt level - beginners should focus on guard retention first and fundamental sweeps initially) do best when they learn the skills of GUARD RETENTION and LEG LOCKING as their first skills to focus upon. All the other skills of guard play are contingent upon being able to hold a guard for extended periods of time against strong passing pressure. Without that as a foundation I can‚Äôt show you anything of value from guard. However, you can‚Äôt just get stuck in defensive cycles where you just defend and defend and defend - you have to carry the attack to your opponent. Learning to tie guard retention into counterattacks is a crucial part of your journey into advanced Jiu jitsu. The most readily available for of attack from guard is leg locking. The legs are almost impossible for an opponent to completely hide from you as he engages in passing. As such, I put a very heavy emphasis on guard retention and leg locking as the basis of my guard play coaching program once students have gone beyond beginner level. Learning to synthesize them leads to a powerful amalgamation of DEFENSIVE RESPONSIBILITY with CONTINUOUS OFFENSE - which is the ideal of good guard play.

"Sharpening your skills is a little like sharpening a knife: When a good blade smith has to sharpen a dull knife he takes it through stages. The first stage involves removing steel from the edge to restore the original geometry. He will use a rough stone that removes a considerable amount of steel. This is the roughest part of the process and the one where lack of expertise can immediately create detrimental results. The toughness of the first stone makes it ideal for removing large amounts of steel but comes at the price of of a jagged, toothy edge that does not cut smoothly. This necessitates the second step, where a smoother stone is used. It won‚Äôt have such a dramatic effect on the edge geometry since it removes far less steel, but it smoothes out the roughness of the first stone‚Äôs work. This process can be repeated several times using progressively smoother stones.  Finally the last step is to gently polish the edge with a leather strop. This does not remove any steel and does not make the edge any sharper, just smoother for perfect cutting. Your training cycles should follow a similar pattern. When you begin a training cycle you want to change your game, just as the blade smith wants to change the geometry of a very dull knife. You will have to add new skills, new tactics. This is a rough time, as the new skills will look clumsy initially. Some will prove workable, others will have to be abandoned. Once you‚Äôve decided which new elements you want to keep and you have a basic working knowledge of the moves, you go to the next stage where you have to refine those new moves and smooth them out and make them more efficient. This is done in stages. Working first against easier opponents and building up to more difficult ones. Finally when the moves are at a satisfactory level, you enter the stropping stage, where periodically you practice the moves, not so much to add anything to them, but just to keep them sharp and smooth for future use - particularly when competitions are approaching. Working in cycles like this will keep your game developing and progressing over the years and give you a lifetime of growth in the sport
"
"The power of escape: When we think of powerful moves in Jiu jitsu you typically picture a slamming takedown or a bone crunching submission hold, or perhaps an immovable pin or unstoppable pass. We don‚Äôt typically think of escapes as demonstration of power - but they are - in a different way. Those typical power moves, hard takedowns, crushing submissions etc are all demonstrations of power over the opponents BODY. Escapes exert their power on an opponents MIND. Imagine working hard to take an opponent down, pass his hard and get to your favorite finishing position and then have an opponent repeatedly escape. Worse still, every time he escapes he immediately counterattacks and almost catches you as you are forced to flee and start all over again. Hard work is tough, but repeated hard work with no forward progress and no prospect of it finishing is hard for the mind to handle.  That‚Äôs exactly what unstoppable escapes do to an opponents mind in a match. If you can send a clear message to an opponent that he has no means of controlling and finishing you - the longer that match goes the worse he will begin to feel inside. Every escape brings your confidence up and his down. In a long match where points are not a consideration this is a huge factor. There is no lonelier feeling than being fatigued and disheartened by repeated frustration of being close to victory but never able to secure in a match that goes until one of you quits and you now know you have no means of making the other guy quit because he can escape all your best positions without a problem. Here Garry Tonon launches into a strong kipping escape out of mount, about to be followed by a devastating heel hook follow up. There is a reason why he attacks so fearlessly and without abandon in his matches - because he fully believes in his ability to get out of any hold should his attack misfire in any way. The power of Escapes is thus not over the body but over your mind and your opponents mind - now THAT‚ÄôS real power
"
"Trouble: In Jiu jitsu we always train ourselves to find the best routes to the best outcomes. The reality is however, that your opponents are doing the same thing and many of those opponents are very talented. As such, it‚Äôs always prudent to prepare yourself for trouble, including the worst kinds of trouble. Getting out of fully locked in joint locks is probably the scariest situation in Jiu jitsu because the price of failure in a competitive match can be a broken limb. Getting the confidence to escape from these scenarios has to begin in the gym. As always, start with lowered pressure so that you can build over time to escape from increasingly tight holds. Make sure your partner understands the difference between extension of a limb and HYPER extension, so that they can create a tension that gives realism but no damage if you don‚Äôt perform the escape moves quite correctly. Learning to keep a calm mind during a crises is half the battle of extricating yourself. Fear doesn‚Äôt make your escapes better - only skill does that
"
"When the gi comes off: Jiu jitsu is a sport with four faces. Gi grappling, No gi grappling, MMA Jiu jitsu and self defense Jiu jitsu. Though they are all part of the same family there are significant differences between them. When it comes to gi vs no gi grappling it‚Äôs important to ask what the most significant differences are between them and even more importantly - what the consequences of those differences are when you‚Äôre on the mat trying to improve. The three most obvious differences are simple enough - First, the gi provides a much greater number and efficiency of strangles. Second, the gi provides a much greater variety and robustness of grips. Third, the gi provides much greater friction between the two athletes that slows the pace of the match in most areas. Getting further into the discussion, the idea of GRIP has important practical ramifications. The grips provided by the gi allow for much greater overall pulling power than the no gi pulling grips. A grip on the lapel is like a grip on a rope - very robust and difficult to break. None of the basic no gi grips can compare in robustness to the grips one can make with the jacket and pants, especially when sweat is factored in. The one great exception to this is LOCKED HANDS. Locking your hands around your opponents waist, head and arm or upper legs (and many other more specific applications) creates by far the strongest and most robust pulling force available no gi. It is crucial you learn to harness and utilize its power and control. You can‚Äôt always lock your hands, nor is it always desirable to do so - but when it is - no other no gi grip gives you such a robust pulling grip that allows you to control the toughest and slipperiest opponents and get to your score or submission.
"
"Tunnel vision: One of the most natural and destructive human tendencies we have in the mat is tunnel vision. When we have an objective in our mind there is a powerful tendency to shut our eyes to other possibilities which may well be more promising. One of my tasks as a coach is to call out those other possibilities as they arise. The choice is still in the hands of the athlete - but at least he or she now works with a CHOICE of options rather than only one - and in a world where selection is done in seconds and can impact the outcome - that‚Äôs an important thing. When you train there is always a voice there to open your peripheral vision - so train yourself to always have at least two options for every second by second moment of attack - you will immediately double your rate of success

"New Wave juniors on fire - Austin Jiu Jitsu getting strong! Last night the @blackwidowinvitational grappling event was held here in Austin and many very talented local competitors came out to show their skills! There were both super fights and an open weight tournament. @luke_griffithjj @davis_asare @helenajiujitsugirl and @landonelmorebjj came out for New Wave. Davis, Helena and Landon all won via submission and Luke Griffith won the open weight tournament, every match via submission to take the trophy! It was really good to see the developing talent here in Austin. Last year at the world championships the relatively small city of Austin won more ADCC medals than any other city in the world! It‚Äôs great to see the effect this is having on young local athletes as they start their own climb towards their goals!
"
"Use the asymmetries of the human body in your favor: A fundamental asymmetry of the human body is that of the massively greater strength and endurance of our lower body over our upper body. Legs are far stronger than arms. Use this asymmetry to win - as much as possible FIGHT YOUR OPPONENTS UPPER BODY WITH YOUR LOWER BODY. This is one of the best ways for smaller, weaker people to defeat bigger, stronger people.  Juji gatame arm bars, triangles and omoplatas etc all do a great job of matching your leg strength against an opponents arm/shoulder/neck strength and as such, are among the best ways to take advantage of this fundamental feature of the human body. Actively look to employ it whenever you can - it is one of the key features of Jiu jitsu
"
"Don‚Äôt be afraid to take a step back sometimes: Jiu jitsu is a game of pressure. As such it‚Äôs natural to want to always pressure forward and let the other fellow feel the heat. However this is also a game where sometimes an opponent can get into a sequence of grips that spell danger and you get the feeling that you can‚Äôt break all those grips before the first attacks will come. In these cases it can be a good thing to break out of there completely and briefly disengage and then step back into the fray with renewed focus to get a better start. Generally the athlete who starts better in a given engagement will tend to dominate the rest of that engagement as they have the tactical momentum in their favor. If you feel this is the case - disengage to break the momentum and start again on your terms. Don‚Äôt be too quick to use this tactic as it can lead to negative play if overused, but acknowledge that there is a time and place for it when you get off to a bad start and it can definitely save you some grief down the line
"
"Class is never really over: Its natural when you‚Äôve just finished a tough class to want to get the hell out of the dojo and head somewhere less strenuous. Note however, that the time immediately after class is probably the time when you have the most honest and realistic assessments of your ability and flaws as you still have the feelings of exasperation and frustration at failed moves and the memory of exactly what they were. There is no better time therefore to puzzle out the problems fighter there after class. Often my students come to me with problems right after a rough day of sparring. Sometimes I have answers based on my similar experiences from years ago - sometimes i don‚Äôt - that‚Äôs fine - then it‚Äôs time to experiment and figure it out. The feeling of finishing a tough workout is good, but the feeling of finishing a tough workout AND knowing what you need to do to perform better tomorrow is even better. Use that time immediately after class - it‚Äôs a great time for improvement.
"
"It all starts with push and pull: once you come to grips with an opponent there will usually be a brief period of push and pull that precedes an attack. This push pull action. Is often overlooked but it is of the greatest importance. In fact, I usually identify the relative expertise level of students by how well that make use of push and pull prior to applying their techniques. The old adage in martial arts is ‚Äúwhen pushed, pull, and when pulled, push.‚Äù There is a lot of wisdom in this. Learning to create reactions and feed off those is critical to your development. You will need to stay relaxed as you play this game within a game and you will need to develop sensitivity to the opponents reactions to your pushing and pulling. Next time you make grips - start engaging in push and pull and stay loose enough to read your opponents reactions and move in response - in time your ability to break through with attacks will increase as a result

"The basis of an opponents defense is his stance - if you can consistently break his stance you can defeat him with your choice of techniques - if you can‚Äôt, it will feel like attacking a castle wall. Study stance - how to maintain it, change from one stance to another as the situation demands, and break the opponent‚Äôs stance and the rest of Jiu Jitsu becomes much easier
"
"Next! The round is over and the next one begins - what‚Äôs going through your head? Remember always that mental engagement is every bit as important as physical engagement in the sparring rounds. In the time between rounds have a sense of who you want to spar with and what skills you want to work on. If you choose some better than yourself it will be a good opportunity to work on survival and escape skills. If it‚Äôs someone bigger and stronger it‚Äôs a good opportunity to work on moving and managing weight from bottom position. If it‚Äôs someone of lesser skill, then it‚Äôs a fine to work on control to submission. If it‚Äôs someone of equal skill, an opportunity to work on wearing an opponent down physically over time to gain tactical advantage over the course of a match. Next time the round ends and you‚Äôre looking around the room - do so with a plan rather than leaving it to chance.
"
"Learn new material all the time - but don‚Äôt forget to maintain your old strengths: There nothing more fun than learning new skills  and some time soon the effort spent learning those new skills will pay off for you but understand that time devoted to new skills inevitably means less time working on your old skills and therefore a slight drop in performance. Don‚Äôt worry too much about this. Remember that it‚Äôs MUCH easier to relearn old skills than it is to learn new skills - so if your old moves decline a little as you seek new directions, a little time spent with them will soon have them back into top form.
"
"Using the power of your hips: In most respects the human body is not particularly impressive in terms of generating power, but the hips and legs are a notable exception. When you can harness the power of your hips in a constructive way, you‚Äôll find your combat effectiveness greatly increases. One of the best examples of this comes when athletes use their hips effectively against takedown attempts. Aggressively checking and stopping an opponents takedown with your hips and then pulling him onto your hips to lift and rotate him enables you to strongly counter takedowns and many forms of wrestling based guard sweeps. Probably the most commonly used variation of this is  uchi mata. You‚Äôll need an upper body connection, usually an over hook, but it‚Äôs the lower body that supplies the horsepower. Learning to quickly fit your hips into and under your opponents hips provides you with a tremendous source of power that you can call on at a moment‚Äôs notice and turn defense into offense
"
"There are many forms of advantage in combat sports - but ANGLE will always be one of my absolute favorites. It‚Äôs never easy to beat tough opponents by barging in the front door, it gets a lot easier when you sneak in the side door. Get to your angle and get to your winning positions üòúüòú
"
"Waiting: There is a time before your match where your preparation is over and now there is nothing but time between you and your opponent. It‚Äôs a lonely situation even in a crowded room because you know that soon you‚Äôll be alone on the mat with your opponent. In that time every fear and doubt you have inside you will show itself. Just know this - rest assured that there is  another room close by where your opponent sits. He is equally alone and every fear and doubt that he has is making itself heard inside his head just as yours do inside your head. Your nervousness is not unique to you. Your affliction is his affliction too. Once you realize this it‚Äôs always a little easier to go out and get to work
"
"Takedowns in Jiu jitsu - favor those where you face your opponent: There are many sins in Jiu jitsu, but the most unforgivable one is BACK EXPOSURE. If you expose your back to your opponent he now gets the highest possible score and has access to the most high percentage submissions in the sport while you can do nothing but defend. As such, when it‚Äôs time to decide what kind of takedowns you should employ, DEGREE OF BACK EXPOSURE is certainly a very important consideration. Some takedowns require you to completely turn your back to an opponent. This certainly enables you to generate great throwing power, but comes at a high price - any slip up on your part and your opponent gets a big score and a very good chance to finish you. In most grappling sports such as Judo, the rules reward risk - if you miss a throw and expose your back, the referee will protect you by intervening and restarting you in standing position. In Jiu jitsu, no one will intervene on your behalf. If you make an error and expose your back, you will have to fight your way out of it and recover. As such, there is an understandable preference for takedowns with minimal back exposure. To be sure, there are other potential dangers besides back exposure, but they are generally not as severe. Here, Gordon Ryan tests the formidable takedown defense of Georges St Pierre with a double leg takedown. As long as his posture is remains strong there is little back exposure. Note how he clears the lead arm to lessen another big risk of leg takedowns - neck exposure - Mr St Pierre has a nasty front headlock. When you start building your takedown repertoire, take into consideration the unique features of Jiu jitsu that may make you favor some takedown methods over others. What are your favorites? How well do they adapt to unique rules and directives of Jiu jitsu?
"
"Breaking connection: The entire game of grappling is based on grip and connection - without those it would all be impossible. It stands to reason then, that in a competitive game where both of you want to establish grip and connection in order to win, learning to BREAK grip and connection is a very important skill. You don‚Äôt want to turn into a negative player who only tries to negate an opponents game with no concern for positive play leading towards victory - that‚Äôs definitely not the spirit you want to approach the game. Nonetheless we have to be realistic and understand that there will definitely be times you need to break potentially dangerous grips opponents have gotten on you in order to shut down their encroaching attacks. In wrestling and judo the grip breaks are almost always centered on the HANDS, but in Jiu jitsu you‚Äôll need to break grips of both the hands AND feet, since many of the most important grip/connection come from guard positions. When you feel an opponent getting a grip that gives them more control over you than you‚Äôre comfortable with - stop what you‚Äôre doing for a moment and break the grip before going back to your positive attacking game
"
"When your opponent knows the same moves you know and also knows the defenses to those moves - the single best way to get them to work is to distract him before the attack with an attack on his balance and stance. It‚Äôs very hard to break through well organized defenses, but if you create chaos first by attacking his balance you‚Äôll soon find it‚Äôs much easier to breach a disorganized defense.
"
"Your game reveals who you are: In daily life you reveal much about yourself by choices you make - you reveal superficial aspects of who you are by where you live, where you work, what car you drive, who you spend time with, how you dress. You reveal deeper aspects by life goals, your most cherished beliefs etc. Jiu jitsu is the same. The kind of game you play, the moves you favor, the manner in which you employ those moves, the level you aspire to and the time and effort you invest in training all spell out much of who you are as a person. The three most important things that influence your Jiu jitsu development are your body, your personality and your teachers. Who you are on the mat will be a reflection of these three factors. Two athletes can have the same favorite moves but have two totally different personalities, say one is brash and confident and the other shy and withdrawn - they may favor the same moves but their differences in personality will make them employ those moves very differently. Two athletes can have similar bodies and personalities but if they come from very different teaching lineages they will usually have very different games. Your body and personality are yours - they are your internal influences. Your teachers are an external influence. When you first begin the external influence is more important because you know nothing and need direction; but as time passes and you mature the internal influences naturally start to take precedence and your game becomes an authentic expression of who you are physically and mentally.
"
"Jiu jitsu on a crowded mat: When I began jiu jitsu the numbers of people per class were rather small. Jiu jitsu was seen a fringe art within the fringe activity of martial arts. The mats we worked out on were always small to keep costs low. As the sport expanded, the mats expanded - but so did the numbers of people on the mats. Most of my career teaching in NYC in my teachers school we averaged seventy to eighty people per class and when big events were coming up that often rose to over a hundred. As such, space was always at a premium. It‚Äôs very important that you develop a sense of how to train in confined areas with other people right next to you so as to avoid unnecessary injury. When we began we had no sense of this at all and just crashed into each other and kept sparring. This led to injuries and anger. When you perform moves in a crowded mat you must have not only of where you START the move, but also where the move will END. So if you‚Äôre about to sweep or takedown a training partner, you must mentally check where people are in relation to where your move will finish. Just as a good shooter never takes a shot at a target without first checking what is behind and beyond the target, so to a good jiu jitsu student always checks what‚Äôs around before engaging a move that will send his partner with force in a given direction. CULTIVATE A SENSE OF WHATS AROUND YOU ON THE MAT. This will make you a responsible student. CULTIVATE THIS SENSE IN THE CLASS AS A WHOLE. This will create a safer training environment. I‚Äôve been knocked out cold twice in my career by unintentional kicks to the back of the head while sparring in class (both times someone was thrown or swept and slammed feet down to the mat and my head got in the way) and I‚Äôve seen numerous broken noses, chipped teeth and facial cuts along the way. Not only will this make you a safer jiu jitsu player, it will make you a better martial artist. Why? Because a great fault of many dojo trained martial artists when they fight in self defense is TUNNEL VISION. Developing a keen sense of your immediate surroundings as you grapple with intensity is a great way to train yourself to see more than your opponent.

"Leg entanglements allow you to stay a step ahead at all times in guard play: An opponent can hide his upper body from submissions quite well no gi simply by standing up. He can negate whole categories of sweeps by switching between standing and kneeling postures. One thing he can never hide by completely by changing stance is his legs - there is always a way to enter. Once you start threatening the legs your opponent cannot simply ignore it - he has to react.  As such you immediately put him in a framework where he is reacting to YOUR game rather than you to his. In combat sports this is a crucial advantage. Here, Garry Tonon ties up the great ADCC champion Vinny Magalhaes in a classic backside 50/50 at the 2015 world championships in Brazil and puts him under strong pressure despite the big size difference. Learning to dictate the pace and get an opponent into a reactive mindset is a crucial part of guard play - learning to attack legs from everywhere is a great way to do it!
"
"Constantly assess your work rate relative to that of your opponent. If you can consistently make him work harder than you then you will have made a weapon out of TIME and many victories will be yours

"Grips - Imposing and denying: Every thing starts with grip in Jiu jitsu. Most of the gripping initiates with the hands, but given that the feet are an essential part of gripping when playing guard they can sometimes initiate gripping as well. You can‚Äôt do much in grappling until some form of grip is established. How that grip is established will usually determine all the next steps of the battle. Both athletes will try to impose their own grips while denying an opponent grips. This initial grip fight is one of the factors most responsible for determining the outcome of the match as a whole - yet is largely ignored as a skill by most students since it is not visually interesting. I can tell within seconds of initiating contact with an athlete what his overall skill level is and what is his tactical plan just based on his gripping and grip sequences. Make sure your gripping game is consistent with your overall game. Make sure also that there is some subtlety in your gripping game. Your grip reveals a LOT about your intentions - so throw some fakery and deceit into your grips as well to make yourself less transparent. This game ends with submission - but it starts with grip
"
"Patience: They say that patience is a virtue. Normally we apply this wisdom in everyday life, but it applies in combat sports also. Experts in Jiu jitsu seem to be able to take their time whilst getting to their goals, while beginners are always in a rush. Interestingly those who take their time usually get to their destination, while those who rush to get there usually don‚Äôt. What‚Äôs the difference? Why can some people take their time and get to a destination while other race to get there and fail? The answer is CONTROL. When you can exert control over an opponents movement you can take your time doing want you want. When you can take your time you can problem solve, switch plans, see emerging opportunities - all the things that make you more successful. When you‚Äôre training next, consciously slow yourself down and focus on CONTROLLING the path to your goal rather than RACING there - in time you will be delighted at the results.
"
"The power of elbow control: A huge part of success in Jiu jitsu becomes from posture - and a big part of good posture in Jiu jitsu is concerned with keeping your elbows close to your hips and torso. The more you can do this, the more difficult it will be for an opponent to control you and open you up to attacks. It stands to reason then, that Taking your opponents elbows out of position, away from the hip and torso, is an excellent way to undermine his game and makes it easier to apply your own. This is particularly important when employing chest to chest pins, but it‚Äôs also a valuable idea when passing half guard. Here I use double underhooks to undermine my partners elbow position and thus make defense from half guard bottom very difficult. Note that head position also becomes important in this context as you can see here. The basis of defense in Jiu jitsu is elbow position- there is a reason why the old masters call them elbow escapes - knock that domino over first  and all the others will soon fall
"
"Using your strengths: We all have moves that we favor and feel more confident using. Pretty soon your training partners and opponents will figure out what they are. Don‚Äôt think your strengths become useless once your opponents realize what they are and develop counter measures - they just have a different function. Now they can be used not as direct attacks but as a means of creating predictable defensive reactions from an opponent that you can capitalize upon. If you have a powerful armbar from guard that opponents fear and posture away from this will create opportunities for sweeps to the rear as opponents overreact to the initial threat. As you develop favorite moves, be sure to develop auxiliary moves around your favorites that take advantage of exaggerated defensive reactions - that way you get twice the value from those favorites of yours!
"
"Getting out of a bad situation is good - but much is getting out of a bad situation and IMMEDIATELY COUNTER ATTACKING so that you seize the initiative of the match again. For every escape there is always a critical point where you have broken away - THAT is the point where your mind should switch from defense to offense and change your action from escape to attack. Don‚Äôt be satisfied with getting out - aim higher and look for counter attacks  the moment you pass the threshold of escape.
"
"Focus vs myopia: When you start to enter a given move in jiu jitsu, there is a natural tendency to focus everything on the execution of that move. This is not a bad thing - you‚Äôll need mental and physical focus to get it to work against a strongly resisting opponent. However, don‚Äôt let your focus degenerate into myopia where you can‚Äôt see past the the move you‚Äôre trying to execute. Remember always that against skilled resistance you‚Äôll most likely need a follow up move or two. So even as your focused on that initial attack, keep a little reserve for a potential follow up just in case the first move doesn‚Äôt get completed.
"
"Sometimes skills carry over directly - sometimes they carry over indirectly: Sometimes you learn a skill that you can see the moment it is taught to you that it will be immediately applicable to your game. So for example, if you specialize in heel hooking and you learn a new and effective way of exposing a heel, you know that you‚Äôll probably be able to apply it very soon and it will fit in very well with what you already do. Other times the skills are applicable, but in a much less direct way. Here, Georges St Pierre works on heel hooking skills in a format applicable to submission grappling - but of course, he is an mma fighter, not a submission grappler, so the skills learned in this rather artificial position won‚Äôt translate directly to the fight situations he normally finds himself in. Even more extreme are the many law enforcement and military personal I teach. Sport Jiu jitsu is very removed from the world in which they operate where there are no mats, weapons are normal, they are dressed in body armor with a full kit that greatly restricts movement. Still, the skills are useful - it just requires more thought about modification and appropriate application, if understanding what needs to be changed for the different environment, rule set (or total lack of rules) etc. There is a lot of useful knowledge out there that can benefit your game - just because it‚Äôs not immediately and directly applicable to your game doesn‚Äôt mean it can‚Äôt be beneficial in some less obvious way - keep an open mind and you may well find that an insight you gained can be applied to your situation in ways that increase your performance
"
"Dilemmas: Whenever you can - attack in pairs of moves rather than a single move. If possible, choose a pair that go in opposite directions so that as opponent defends one he walks into the other. For example, when getting past an opponents defensive arms you can attack inside the arms towards the centerline or outside the arms at an angle towards the back - the more an opponent invests in defending one, the more vulnerable he becomes to the other. Play these two off against each other and you‚Äôll find it much easier to get past resistance. This foundational principle is at the heart of all good jiu jitsu.
"
"The real test of match intensity control is when you‚Äôre in trouble: You‚Äôll often hear me advocating a fairly relaxed demeanor when engaged in a grappling match, even a very high intensity one. Anyone can be relaxed and calm when they‚Äôre winning and in good position - the real test comes when your in trouble and your opponent is attacking well and has you under pressure and close to scoring or even submitting you - THAT‚ÄôS when you‚Äôll see if you can control your physical intensity levels well. We all have a natural tendency to tighten up and over exert ourselves when we feel a threat, and more threatened we feel the worse it gets. Learning to relax so you don‚Äôt burn out and can make good decisions in these situations is a good differentiator between average and very good athletes. Next time you‚Äôre in trouble on the mats see how calm and relaxed you can be rather than just trying to instinctively explode out of everything - it‚Äôs an attribute that‚Äôll pay big dividends the higher you go in the sport.

"A short chat with Lex Fridman: My friend Lex Fridman and I recently did another podcast - it got completely out of hand and went a marathon four and a half hours! We talked mostly about ADCC 2022 and the stellar performances of Gordon Ryan, Giancarlo Bodoni, Nicholas Meregali and the Ruotolo twins. After that things got crazy as people offered their own questions which immediately went Straight to animal fights - grizzly bear vs Lion! üòÇüòÇ It was a fun rambling chat and Alex always has a way of making things fun and interesting - hope you enjoy it!

"Great night of grappling in Costa Mesa: The big WNO grappling show had some great action tonight. Unfortunately we came up short in our two matches. Giancarlo Bodoni lost a decision to current champion Pedro Merinho when Mr Merinho completed two nice takedowns. JT Torres had an impressive comeback win showcasing his well known positional skills. In the main event Felipe Pena won a very tightly contested thirty minute bout against Nick Rodriguez. It was a titanic bout that was so evenly matched that neither could complete an attack. Mr Rodriguez got very close with two guard passes and two nice leg lock attempts. Mr Pe√±a got close with two attempts to take the back, one of which was very close. It was was a very difficult match to score but the judges favored Mr Pena - either way it was a great match and both athletes did very well to press their attacks against such tough opposition. It‚Äôs great to see a big venue being filled for a Saturday night of grappling - this sport is growing well!

"Team New Wave wins three out of four judges categories at ADCC 2022: The staff at ADCC made their judgements for the four traditional ‚ÄúBest of‚Äù categories for the event - Best Athlete - Fastest submission - Best takedown - Best match. Gordon Ryan won Best athlete after arguably the greatest ADCC performance in history. He also won fastest submission with a devastating heel hook in the semi finals of his weight division. Nicholas Meregali won Best takedown with a truly beautiful uchi mata throw against phenom Tye Ruotolo in the open weight division. He very narrowly edged out New Wave team mate, Giancarlo Bodoni‚Äô beautiful Sasae foot sweep against defending champion Matteaus Diniz en route to his gold medal win. It was interesting that the two most highly rated takedowns of the tournament were both more Judo oriented takedowns rather than the more common wrestling based ones. It is incredible to think that he never trained takedowns and always pulled guard throughout his career and then after around four months of training won the award for best takedown. Best match was won by B Team standout Izaak Michell who had an absolute barn burning back and forth war with the great Vagner Rocha in a match that could have gone either way and which no one who saw it will forget. Interestingly all three founding members of the squad, Garry Tonon, Eddie Cummings and Gordon Ryan have won fastest submission award and all three did it via leg lock - two outside heel hooks and one inside heel hook. This is the second time our team has won three out of four of the judges prizes (2019 was the previous time) - a tribute to the athletes ability to not only be effective, but also to embody the ideals of good jiu jitsu in an exciting fashion that helps the sport grow. There is a lesson there for all of us - your first duty as an athlete is to win, but your second duty is to train yourself to win a way that embodies an ideal that appeals to a new generation of athletes and ensures the positive growth of the sport.
"
"Finding balance: When you look at world championships competitions it‚Äôs often quite a shock to see how incredibly resistant the top athletes are to any type of sweep attempts. They just seem to be able to hang suspended in air, cartwheel, handstand and flip like cats back on to their base and prevent a score. Then the next time you‚Äôre in the gym and someone gets a sweep on you, you try to resist and fall like a one legged drunk. How does one develop that level of balance? Remember when you first learned to ride a bicycle? Did you have perfect balance when you started? No - you feel many times. Friend and family offered advice but what ultimately gave you the ability to ride in balance was persistence. The same is true of any balance based activity - skateboarding, skiing, surfing, ice skating etc. Theoretical advice can help to a degree but at the end of the day there are some ineffable elements where you simply have to go out and do the task long enough to be able to perform. As always, start small and build over time. Put yourself in a sweep applied with low to moderate force and learn to ride it. At first you‚Äôll fall plenty of times - just like you did on your front lawn when you were a kid. Hang in there and soon enough you‚Äôll be able to resist a sweep long enough to go into an effective counter!
"
"From guard almost everything begins with an attack on the opponents balance: Here I am demonstrating a double leg entry into cross ashi garami. Note how it begins, as almost all attacks from guard so, as an attack on the opponents balance that forces hands to floor in reaction and then going from there. Your opponent can‚Äôt ignore such an attack, his reaction and your preferences will determine the direction and choice of your response - but it all begins with balance.
"
"Starting with an advantage: Imagine if you were practicing takedowns with an opponent your own size and skill level and he told you he would let you start in a full single position - no hand fighting, no level changing, no shooting needed - you get the position for free. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôd be pretty happy about that because it would take out some of the most difficult elements of takedowns and let you start with  half the task already completed. Well, that‚Äôs pretty much what happens when you start in a good half guard position with an under hook. You essentially start in a single leg position. No need for all the difficulties of hand fighting, level changing and shooting - you‚Äôre already in on the leg and ready to go - that‚Äôs a big advantage! You could also say similar things about getting to an opponents back - you‚Äôre half way there also - the only thing between you and your opponents back is his over hook/wizzer. Beat that and the back is yours. Next time you‚Äôre working from half guard  with an under hook - remind yourself that you begin half way to a single leg and/or the back and take heart that by getting to half guard you‚Äôve gotten half way to two great situations before the action has even begun!
"
"Don‚Äôt be satisfied with good when great is right there for the taking: Getting into a dominant pin is a good thing but if you want to go the extra distance and progress from position to submission, then you must learn to isolate limbs away from the torso to set up submission entries. Don‚Äôt congratulate yourself when you get to your pin - immediately start the task of isolating an arm and head. It will make it tougher for him to escape and easier for you to finish. The earlier you start the task the better your chances of succeeding. Program yourself to WORK from the pin rather than REST from the pin, and you will be a finisher faster than you thought possible
"
"Danger zones and safe zones: Any time you pass through dangerous territory you would never stop in an area that appeared even more dangerous than usual, rather, you‚Äôd keep moving until you came across an area that appeared less dangerous, only then would you take a break, reorganize and plot your next move. Jiu jitsu is no different. There are some positions relative to your opponent that are just too dangerous to stop and take a break. There are others that are safe enough to take a temporary respite and use some time to make a good next move. How safe these areas really are will vary. Really dominant positions such as rear mount give you great opportunities to really slow things down and consider your options. More often the safety zones are not that safe - they just take away the immediate threat. Here, Brian Glick steps off line to get away from the immediate threat from Gordon Ryan‚Äôs very dangerous guard. He has stepped out of a danger zone (directly in front of the legs) to a zone thats offers a very temporary safety - he will have to move quickly from here if he is to advance to greater safety and prevent being put right back into the danger zone. Make your early movements when you first engage away from immediate danger zones and work progressively through the various safety zones and you‚Äôll be able to focus more on offense and get less distractions from having to fend off your opponents attacks.

Amazing work again from these hard working athletes!!
"
"Breaking posture: If there is one word of advice I could give students who are trying to attack an opponent with positional moves or submission a greater chance of success it would be this - START EVERY ATTACK WITH AN ATTACK ON YOUR OPPONENTS POSTURE. Your opponents defense is only as strong as the integrity of his posture. Break his posture and it will be relatively easy to break whatever else you want. Here, Gordon attacks the back with an initial attack on his opponents posture that destroys the defensive integrity of his turtle position - opening his up to both positional and submission attacks that will now easily follow
"
"Where there is danger there is sometimes opportunity: The game of Jiu jitsu is essentially a game of risk management. You want certain outcomes - getting those outcomes will entail a degree of risk. You try always to lower the risk as much as possible but always there is the understanding that nothing risked, nothing gained. While it‚Äôs in our best interests to general seek to lower risk to the greatest degree we can, there is no denying that sometimes we can get excellent results by INCREASING risk - provided we do so in a way that we can control to an acceptable degree. Probably the riskiest thing you can do in Jiu jitsu is expose your back to your opponent. However, there are things you can do to mitigate the risk to some degree, and as a reckless opponent over extends himself going for your back some interesting counter attacks become available - some of which can lead directly to victory. Here I am demonstrating how leaving an open door to your back via elbow position can bring an opponent on to some very strong leg locking positions. When your usual attacks aren‚Äôt getting the breakthroughs you need there can be times when upping the risk can turn a match in your favor. Learn to make risk assessments and marry these to specialized techniques and you can start drawing overzealous opponents into traps that can get breakthroughs that direct attacks could not
"
"Express yourself: When you hear me talk about jiu jitsu you might think I believe it‚Äôs all soulless mechanics, physics and rational decision making - a cold science. I do believe that these are the main factors that make jiu jitsu effective. Let‚Äôs be clear however, Jiu jitsu has the features of both science AND art. It is scientific insofar as mechanical and biomechanical laws are the core of its operations. However, all jiu jitsu involves the element of CHOICE. You choose among competing options as to what you will do on the mat. These choices will be a reflection of your body type and personality. They will inevitably be a form of SELF EXPRESSION. The most important thing is that your expression be AUTHENTIC. Let your game be a true reflection of who you are. Don‚Äôt try to emulate another person - you just end up looking like a bad copy. Don‚Äôt worry about what shape your authentic self expression will take - it will grow organically over time as naturally as your body grew from childhood to adulthood. Just as no one had to tell your body how to grow, neither will anyone have to tell you how your personal game will grow - it will do so all by itself over time.
"
"This a sport where seemingly insignificant shifts of position of a hand, a foot, your hips or head, can mean the difference between a move working or not moving, and hence, between victory and defeat. Better to study a few moves deeply then, rather than many moves in a shallow fashion. You will be rewarded for the DEPTH of your knowledge more so than the BREADTH of your knowledge. Once you discover which moves have potential for you - study deeply and relentlessly. There is no end to improvement - even for moves you‚Äôve been performing for years. There‚Äôs always something more than can potentially improve your performance. You can skimp on many things in life but study and practice is not one of them.

"Counting down in El Paso: Giancarlo Bodoni @giancarlobodoni and Luke Griffith @luke_griffithjj going through their final drills in preparation for the big EBI open weight tournament tomorrow night at 10th Planet El Paso. Now it‚Äôs back to the hotel and get ready for the show!
"
"A fundamental dilemma between positional attacks and submission attacks: Question 1: What is the most difficult type of body posture to sweep? Answer: extended/spread limbs that create wide base with lowered center of gravity. Question 2: What is the most difficult body posture to attack with submissions? Answer: retracted  limbs held close to the torso. As soon as you see the truth of these two answers to our two questions you will understand that the sequence of a positional attack from guard (sweep) will create a reaction (extended limbs) that makes an opponent much easier to submit; whilst a submission attack creates a reaction (retracted limbs/narrow base) that makes them easier to sweep. ALWAYS TRY TO CREATE AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS FUNDAMENTAL POSITION/SUBMISSION DILEMMA AS IT APPLIES TO POSTURE. Your opponent can defend the first only at the cost of making himself more vulnerable to the second. Whenever you play the game, particularly from guard position, keep this in mind and you will get more breakthroughs than previously

"Seeing an old friend in Melbourne - the story of John Donehue: Many years ago when I began training in New York City I would often hear of a talented Australian grappler with a very similar name and story to mine - so similar in fact that many people thought we were the same person! Over a decade later I was teaching a class when a very well mannered man introduced himself to me as John Donehue - I finally met my grappling doppelg√§nger! We became good friends. Mr Donehue had an impeccable grappling pedigree. He is a Sixth degree black belt under the great Rigan Machado and one of a handful of people who got a black belt from legendary Judo/catch wrestling icon Judo Gene Labelle. In addition he was a student and training partner of the great Iowa wrestler Rico Chiaperelli and worked extensively with the legendary RAW MMA team in the early days of MMA. As such he has a very unique perspective and approach to grappling that encompasses Jiu jitsu, catch, judo and wrestling at the highest levels. His grappling knowledge is extraordinary and so is his insight into the early California Jiu jitsu and grappling scene. Here in  South East Melbourne I taught seminars today at his school - it was wonderful to see what a great job he has done raising excellent students who were able to quickly absorb the material we went over. If you‚Äôre ever in Melbourne this a great place to train!!

"When to be fast and when to be slow: Jiu jitsu is a game of variable pace. If you try to sprint the whole time you‚Äôll soon be exhausted. If you move like a sloth the whole time you‚Äôll be late for every engagement and have to constantly fight out of bad positions. So where is the happy medium? WHEN YOU ARE IN CONTROL OF YIUR OPPONENTS MOVEMENT SLOW THE ACTION DOWN; WHEN YOU DO NOT CONTROL YOUR OPPONENTS MOVEMENT SPEED THE ACTION UP. This simple rule will give you a good initial direction with regards pace control next time you‚Äôre sparring a tough opponent and worried about keeping a pace that enables you to last the distance
"
"Starting with a skill set - the example of a Nicky Rod: A situation I often see as a coach is that of a talented athlete from another sport such as wrestling, Judo or Sambo coming into Jiu jitsu. It‚Äôs natural to want to use and adapt your skills to the new game. This conversion can be done fairly quickly and easily and usually gets good results. My belief however, is that it will rarely get you GREAT results. You have to go further and learn new skills from the bottom up in your new sport if you really want to become exceptional. A good example is that of Nicky Rod. He was a high school wrestler - he also did a year in D3 college - so he had a solid enough  background in wrestling without being anything exceptional. Whenever you‚Äôre in this situation it‚Äôs natural to just train in Jiu jitsu so as to exploit this initial skill set that you have. So wrestlers will often just work submission defense and look to develop a game that lets them win on their primary skill - takedowns. This will win you matches at local level but will never get you to championship level. To do that you have to immerse yourself in the new game you are studying. It‚Äôs not easy to give up a strength and work on a weakness. It‚Äôs so much easier just to stay within the safety of your strength. Nicky Rod did a fine job of practicing in new skill areas - guard position, submission holds and guard passing. It showed this weekend when he took on the great Yuri Simoes. Yuri is one of only three people who have won two gold medals in two weight classes in ADCC (Gordon Ryan and Jeff Monson are the other two). Most people thought Nicky Rod‚Äôs only path to victory was through wrestling takedowns. Even though Yuri is one of the best takedown artists in Jiu jitsu he intelligently sat to guard to deny what most people thought was the only way Nicky Rod could win. What happened next was shocking for many observers. Nicky Rod went immediately on the offense with a pure Jiu jitsu skill - guard passing. In fact there was almost zero wrestling in this match. It was won with Jiu jitsu skills. It was a fine example of immersion in a new sport winning at high levels - an example many others can learn and profit from
"
"Failure? Or opportunity? Let‚Äôs face the facts - the overwhelming majority of moves you attempt in sparring or competition will fail. This is true regardless of your skill level. As you get better, so do your opponents. As you learn new moves, they learn new counters. If you try a hundred moves on a given days training you can expect ninety of them to fail. Given this fact, it‚Äôs up to you to shift your perspective on failure. EVEN A FAILED MOVE WILL ELICIT A DEFENSIVE REACTION FROM YOUR OPPONENT (indeed that defensive reaction is usually the reason why it failed). YOUR JOB IS TO USE THAT DEFENSIVE REACTION TO SET UP THE SUBSEQUENT MOVE(S) THAT SUCCEED. Get rid of the Fail-Stop mentality that most people carry into jiu jitsu and adopt the Fail - Opportunity mind set instead. If you stop every time you perceive failure then you really will fail. If you immediately switch to a follow up move appropriate to the defensive reaction you elicited from the initial failure, then (initial) failures will become one the main sources of your success. Every time you experience failure, have a follow up mapped out and suddenly you‚Äôll find that getting stopped one way by an opponent is just an invitation to a different route to success.

"The best two grapplers I ever saw: We had the privilege of hosting the great Roger Gracie @rogergracie at the gym today. Roger was by far the greatest Jiu Jitsu athlete of his generation and the greatest all round Jiu jitsu player of all time. He has always been a source of tremendous inspiration both to the jiu jitsu world at large and me and my students. Roger and I met many years ago in NYC and I have have always coached according to the ideal that he set of ruthlessly hunting for submission victory above all else. It was amazing to see him training once again with my students as he did so many times back in NYC. His game still looks incredible!! Roger is in Austin doing a podcast with @lexfridman I will write more tomorrow about this podcast - I spoke to Lex today and it sounds awesome! Stay tuned for more on Rogers thoughts on Jiu jitsu!
"
"Breathing: One of the most fundamental operations of the human body is breathing. When breathing gets interrupted it will elicit reactions from an opponent in seconds. When you‚Äôre behind someone you can attack their breathing directly at the nostrils and mouth by simply cupping them with your hand; and you can attack their breathing indirectly by locking a body triangle tight around the waist in ways that compress the diaphragm. In the intensity of a match where athletes are short on breath at all times, even a small interruption to breathing cycles can be catastrophic. Learning to attack your opponents breathing is thus a big part of creating physical pressure that melts an opponent‚Äôs resolve and wins wars of attrition. It can create reactions that open up even the toughest defenses and leads to other, cleaner forms of submission
"
"It‚Äôs damn hard to hide your legs from someone who is actively looking for them: One of the most obvious features of the leg lock revolution in Jiu jitsu was the prevalence of leg locking from bottom position rather than the more favored top position of earlier generations. When I began Jiu jitsu leg locking was usually seen as an alternative to passing guard from top position - if you couldn‚Äôt pass - you tried some leg locks instead. This opened leg locks to the old criticism that if they failed you lost top position. Over time I came to believe that in fact the most profitable entries into leg locks were generally from bottom position where they could be easily combined with a traditional positional sweeping game and take advantage of opponents basing their legs out wide to avoid sweeps and making themselves easy marks for leg attacks. When my students began winning many matches with this method many assumed the reason I favored leg lock attacks as the foundation of our guard attacks is that most opponents of that era did not know much about defending leg locks. This is incorrect. Even when my students spar against each other and know that their opponents have excellent leg lock defense, I STILL advocate using leg locks as the basis of their guard game. Why? BECAUSE THE LEGS ARE IMPOSSIBLE TO HIDE FROM AN OPPONENT WHO KNOWS HOW TO ATTACK THEM. Even if the leg locks are well defended by a knowledgeable opponent, THEY PUT THE OPPONENT IN A REACTIVE MINDSET WHERE HE IS MORE CONCERNED WITH DEFENDING HIS LEGS THAN PASSING YOUR GUARD - and once you get them in a reactive mindset you will dominate the direction of the ensuing action. THAT was the tactical reasoning behind making leg lock attacks the centerpiece of our guard game. There is no stance an opponent can take that will hide his legs from attack - it doesn‚Äôt matter whether he is standing, staggered or square, on one knee, kneeling, squatting, feet inside or feet outside - whatever - there is always a path to SOME variation of ashi garami and the resulting attacks. This even in a room full of leg lock experts it still makes sense to make leg locks a foundation of your guard game.
"
"First responsibilities: You have many responsibilities in Jiu jitsu on the path to victory, but it‚Äôs important to understand that some take precedence over others. Why? Because until some more fundamental responsibilities have been addressed, you can‚Äôt move on to the next. In bottom position your first responsibility is always to ensure that YOU KEEP YOUR LEGS BETWEEN YOU AND YOUR OPPONENT. Only then can you hope to prevail against bigger, stronger opponents from underneath, only then can you make bottom positions prevail against top. Your ability to get your legs between you and your opponent and keep them there long enough to attack successfully is the first responsibility of bottom position. Like any other basic responsibility - don‚Äôt lose track of it and make damn sure you satisfy it before you try to move on to anything else. In your training make sure you master this to a sufficient extent before moving off into other skills because none of those other skills will be worth a penny if you can‚Äôt first get and then maintain your legs between you and your opponent.
"
"Multiple lines of attack: When you have but one attack in a given scenario you‚Äôll be successful as long as you are matched against people who don‚Äôt know your game. Once you start showing everyone what that attack is however, they‚Äôll learn quickly and develop defenses that stop that one line of attack. That‚Äôs why we all have a need to develop multiple lines of attack from all our favorite positions and moves, so that opponents can never know what‚Äôs next. Best of all are dilemma/trilemma pairings where one horn of the dilemma creates a reaction that facilitates the other horn of the dilemma and vice versa. One of the very best moves in this regard is the REAR TRIANGLE ushiro sankaku. It creates several dilemmas at once. The first is between the dual threat of strangle and joint locks. The more an opponent resists one, the easier the other becomes. The second is between the various joint locks available, probably more than any other hold. You have juji gatame armlock, kimura, Americana and a nasty wrist lock thrown in for good measure. With all those options it will be very difficult for an opponent to stop them all, even they know it‚Äôs among your favorite moves.
"
"Memory: The great challenge of Jiu jitsu learning is not how much you can learn - it is HOW MUCH YOU CAN RECALL UNDER STRESS. That is what matters. As such, memory and retention is among the most important factors in your progress. Everyone learns and remembers differently. Some learn and retain best with WRITING - that was always my favorite method; others never write a thing and have other methods, repetition, a seminal imprinting experience that burns the knowledge into their memory - whatever works for you. If you ARE the type that favors writing as a memory aid, you don‚Äôt need to write everything you practiced down in excruciating detail every day. Just note the main ideas that were new in bullet point form. If it‚Äôs a move that you learned, just write the two or three most important elements in order of importance. If it‚Äôs a concept, describe it‚Äôs value and main applications that apply to you. Even if you never read those notes again in your life, the mere act of focus and writing has a good clarifying effect on your thinking that will carry over into your grappling and overall thinking about the game. If you are ever injured and off the mats for a time, try writing as a temporary substitute for mat time and see how much you can recall and how clearly you can expound it. You might be surprised at how it helps you when you return
"
"Pinning is a weapon: We normally think of the submission holds of Jiu Jitsu - strangles and joint locks - as the weapons of the sport. This is because they are what do the serious damage to an opponent. There is a sense however, in which high pressure pinning can be a weapon also. They may not break joints or render anyone unconscious but done well, they certainly can create so much discomfort and claustrophobia that they can make inexperienced opponents submit and even experienced opponents so miserable that they will expose themselves to submissions just to escape that misery. Just as you put a lot of study into your favorite submissions, so to must you out study into your favorite pins. In particular learn how to control an opponent through his or her HEAD. Even though most of the heavy pins feature chest to chest positions, it‚Äôs not so much weight on the chest that makes opponents miserable as it is the use of their jaw as a lever to control their head. Next time you‚Äôre pinning your training partners take your time and let them simmer and cook for a while rather than rushing to the submission - you may well find that submission comes a lot easier when you finally decide to go for it

"Control them with your LEGS, generate breaking horsepower through your HIPS, transmit that power to the target through your ARMS - this is the pattern of winning jiu jitsu.

"Uke and tori: Almost all drilling in Jiu jitsu is done with one athlete who is PERFORMING the move being practiced (Tori - the executor of the technique), and the other athlete who is BEING PERFORMED UPON (Uke - the receiver of the technique). One of the best ways to learn in Jiu jitsu is to be the Uke to a more advanced Tori. When I started Jiu jitsu I was just another face in the room, but in time I became Uke to my sensei, Renzo Gracie, and my seniors Matt Serra, Ricardo Almeida and Rodrigo Gracie. At first I was dreadful. Clumsy, out of place and poorly positioned. But as time passed I benefitted immensely as first, I felt what perfectly executed technique should feel like first hand, and in time I got closer and closer to replicating that in my own training. Second, I gained insight on technique that can only come from FEELING it rather than just watching it. Third, I learned about the correct reactions to the technique as they were taught in chains and combinations. When you are the Uke in training - see it for what it is - a grand opportunity to boost your skill level indirectly. Don‚Äôt turn your mind off when you‚Äôre the Uke and then turn it back on when you‚Äôre the Tori. Be an active and alert Uke who learns to balance just the right amount of light resistance with cooperation and good reaction and I promise YOU WILL LEARN ALMOST AS MUCH BEING THE UKE DURING DRILLS AS BEING THE TORI. Soon the best people in the dojo will want to drill with you and you will accelerate your learning even faster. If you are the guy that when it‚Äôs time to get a partner for drills and everyone walks away from you and no one makes eye contact or says they‚Äôre injured - that‚Äôs a pretty good sign that you are a lousy Uke and need to improve üòÇüòú (I know because I was that guy when I started üòÇüòÇ). Over the years my students were all outstanding ukes and daily work in this capacity helped their progress as much as it helped mine. You can almost always make an accurate assessment of a students overall technical level by their proficiency in playing Uke - so when you‚Äôre training, work hard to be the best Uke you can to maximize every means of making development.
"
"The fight for position: ‚Äúposition before submission‚Äù is the great cliche of Jiu jitsu. Like most cliches it is an over simplification but with a lot of truth to it. There are two great positional battles in Jiu jitsu. The first is the battle to get past the legs into chest to chest positions. The second is to get past the elbows to chest to back positions. There are others, but those are the two most important. If you can win those two battle consistently, you‚Äôll win a lot of matches - this I can promise you. Look at your opponents elbows for what they are - an obstacle to be flanked. Make that a habit and you‚Äôll make winning a habit!
"
"I am very happy to announce the release of the first instructional video of the NEW WAVE JIU JITSU series A NEW PHILOSOPHY OF POSITIONAL ESCAPES which focus on the escape skills that enable my students to attack with total confidence - knowing that if their attacks ever compromise their position they can easily escape and get right back into attack. Many people were shocked to see how squad stars like Garry Tonon and Gordon Ryan escaped easily from the best attacking positions in Jiu Jitsu to dominate EBI Overtime in competition even against much larger and more experienced opponents. In addition I show my maximizing approach to escape, which strongly emphasizes immediate submission counter attack after escape as one of the best ways to increase your submission percentages and keep the momentum in your favor at all times.

"The basis of jiu jitsu - Take away an opponents freedom of movement: An opponent who is free to move as they please is a dangerous opponent. One of the cornerstones of jiu jitsu is the idea that you must be able to control an opponents movement in order to control the outcome of a fight or match. Control of movement comes in degrees. It starts with something as mild as a wrist grip and builds up to control of the hips and core, becomes still more powerful when you go to the ground and can use the combination of floor, gravity and your body forming blocks and wedges to make movement very difficult for an opponent. It culminates in situations where you have your legs controlling your opponents upper body preferably on top of him so that he finds any kind of movement extremely difficult. Learning to progressively gain greater and greater control over your opponents movement is close to the very soul of jiu jitsu and is the element of the art that allows you not only to win - BUT TO CHOOSE HOW YOU WIN AND WITH WHATEVER DEGREE OF VIOLENCE, RANGING FROM VERY MILD TO EXTREME, YOU CHOOSE. Don‚Äôt accept situations where an opponent stands unfettered in front of you - make contact early and progress rapidly  to greater and greater contact until you have complete control. This is the spirit of jiu jitsu
"
"Are you ready for the next move? If there is one certainty in Jiu jitsu it is that the majority of your attempted moves will fail. This is a simple reflection of the fact that your opponents know the same moves you do and also the counters. Given the prevalence of failure it is crucial that you have mapped out what to do the moment you feel that the move has failed and recovery is not possible. We all spend our Jiu jitsu lives seeking to achieve success, but in reality the smart way to approach things is to seek to recover and exploit failure since this is far more common than success. Here Nicky Ryan has lost control of his opponents knee - a clear sign that this heel hook/knee bar attempt has failed beyond recovery - the only question now is where to go from here. If you are asking the question now - it‚Äôs already too late. You must train yourself to ask it before that critical moment.

"Isolation: Jiu jitsu is the art and science of control that leads to submission - and submission requires the ISOLATION of a vulnerable target (joints and blood supply to the brain) that can be attacked through the use of the leverage of your own limbs. Arguably the best of these acts of isolating targets are those where the LEGS are used to isolate targets in the upper body. This keeps your game in line with a fundamental feature of the human body - the fact that the legs are inherently stronger than the limbs of the upper body. A smaller and weaker persons legs will be stronger than a bigger and stronger persons arms and neck. Staying true to this principle is a good way for smaller, weaker people to defeat bigger, stronger people. One of the best examples of this principle are TRIANGLES and ARM BARS (juji gatame), as they use your legs to control the opponents head and shoulders. Taller, longer athletes generally develop an affinity more for triangles; shorter, stockier athletes typically develop an affinity more for arm bars. Take your pick - but remember the principles - your legs vs your opponents upper body - isolate the targets and you‚Äôll be a dangerous opponent for even bigger and stronger adversaries
"
"Georges St Pierre and Gordon Ryan work on their standing grappling skills: Most of the work in Jiu jitsu is done on the floor. The highest scores and submissions are almost always attained on the mat. Nonetheless standing grappling is a truly vital part of the game, particularly when you explore the relationship between sport Jiu jitsu and fighting. Jiu jitsu has always historically had what I call a ‚Äúbolt on‚Äù approach towards standing skills - they simply ask you to study wrestling (no gi) or judo (Gi) and bolt those skills on to your Jiu jitsu skills. That can definitely work, but understand that the unique rule set of Jiu jitsu offers many possibilities and opportunities to score and win that go outside of those sports. I believe that long term, Jiu jitsu must develop its own standing game appropriate for its own rule set, which allows the athletes to scrimmage for points and submissions that are quite unique and very interesting and develop a new set of skills in the fascinating grey zone between standing and ground where scramble and scrimmage for the points and positions of the unique Jiu jitsu rule set is the order of the day.
"
"You don‚Äôt have to rush: There are some times in Jiu jitsu where both you and your opponent know what you want to do. Attack will be more difficult know since your opponent will be putting himself in a strong defensive position. It‚Äôs tempting to rush it - perhaps if you get the move into operation fast enough you‚Äôll get there before his position is set. Maybe, maybe not. Often a better way of doing things is stop and then let the opponent relax a little as he assumes you believe the move will no longer work against his defensive position - and then just as you feel him relax - go hard back into the move. Here, Georges St Pierre has one of his favorite grappling moves, Kimura from bottom half guard. Rather than attacking hell for leather against a good opponent who has already assumed a sound defensive position, you can see him waiting in a state of relaxed preparedness. He‚Äôs looking for feedback from his opponent. If he feels the opponent relax a little, he will explode into the kimura and get he opponents hand behind his back and force a roll either into top position or submission. This waiting game can be a great tactic in an apparent deadlock - make sure you learn to relax in sparring you you can think and act in this tactical fashion rather than just as fast and hard as you can

"Air time: Sweeps in Jiu jitsu all score the same amount regardless of amplitude. Indeed powerful sweeps often result in reduced control after the sweep and allow an opponent to scramble out to avoid conceding the score. Nonetheless there is something to be said for big sweeps - they have a disorienting effect that can sometimes lead into submission attempts after the sweep. In addition they create a definite sense of power that will send a message to opponent and create some fear/respect for the next sweep that may create over reactions that you can exploit. So even though most of the time control is more important than amplitude, every so often you can let fly and make an opponent fly the unfriendly skies üòúüòú

"The dual role of pins: a huge part of jiu jitsu‚Äôs approach to combat is PINNING. Pins are defined as positions where you have gotten past your opponents legs and are pinning him with chest or knee, or you have taken his back and locked yourself in place using your legs as hooks into his hips. The first role of pins is NEGATION. These positions strongly negate your opponents ability to attack you. As such they create a highly desirable asymmetry between your ability to attack them (very high) and their ability to attack you (very low). The second is PRESSURE. Pins allow for great TACTICAL pressure because if you attempt a submission and fail, you still have the position and so can simply try again and again until you succeed. They also allow great MECHANICAL pressure because you can severely interrupt their breathing and apply severe and direct pressure to the head and the opponent cannot use his legs to relieve this pressure. These two features of pinning allow you to enter into the most important aspect of pinning in jiu jitsu with regards submissions - the notion of switching from PINNING THE TORSO to ISOLATING A LIMB. Only when you make this transition do pins become related to submission. This must always be your goal, if not your pins are merely a method of holding people rather than a devastating method of enforcing submission.

"Seminar for Marcelo Garcia in Las Vegas: One of the greatest Jiu jitsu athletes of all time, Marcelo Garcia - four time ADCC champion and multi time IBJJF champion was recently diagnosed with stomach cancer and has undergone what appears to be a successful treatment. On Wednesday August 30 in Las Vegas his great friend and training partner Bernardo Faria has organized a super seminar to help raise money for post treatment expenses and related  medical costs. The seminar will feature Bernardo, Gordon Ryan, Nicholas Meregali and myself. One hundred percent of money raised will go directly to Mr Garcia and his family. Marcelo Garcia gained his fame on the mats with many  legendary performances and his dedication to the ideal of Jiu jitsu - winning by submission and fearlessly taking on bigger opponents in the absolute division. He inspired an entire generation of Jiu Jitsu athletes and massively helped the rise of No gi Jiu jitsu competition while also dominating traditional gi competition. He was more than a great competitor, he was the ideal of a true gentleman off the mats while a killer on the mats. In the tribalistic and fractured world of Jiu jitsu where often everyone sees anyone else from another school or another point of view as an enemy, he was one of the few who was loved and revered by all. It‚Äôs an honor to help in a small way at this seminar and try to help such a great man recover from yet another win against a the most formidable enemy we can ever face. The seminar will be before the Masters World Championships in Las Vegas - if you‚Äôre in town and want to support a great man and a great cause - come by and participate! Seminar will be no gi Jiu jitsu - seminar poster in my Instagram story for details

"Daylight: When it‚Äôs time to restrain an opponents movement you want to connect as tightly to him as possible. A simple test to assess the level of connection you‚Äôve achieved is the daylight test. The more daylight you see between your limbs, torso and head - the weaker the connection between you and your opponent. When you want to shut down movement through connection, be sure to fit the shape of your body into that of your opponent so that there is very little daylight between you. If you can combine that level of connection with good positioning, you will be a very difficult opponent to shake off. This will require an interesting compromise between softness and hardness on your part. Your body will need to be soft enough to conform to the shape of your opponents body for connection without daylight, but hard enough to have sufficient muscular tension to stay connected to a strongly resisting opponent.

"The remarkable story of Brian Glick: I am mostly known through the exploits of my incredible students and their success in MMA and grappling over the years. What is less known is that I have many students who never competed who are every bit as good as the competitors. A true legend and hidden gem of the blue basement is the inestimable Brian Glick, one of my senior black belts. I am often asked by people - can I get good at Jiu jitsu if I start late? If I am small and unathletic? If I‚Äôm not a competitive/aggressive person? If I have no background in martial arts whatsoever? If I have a family/career? I always smile and say ‚Äúlook at Brian Glick. When Mr Glick first began Jiu jitsu in the late 1990‚Äôs classes were very rough with frequent dojo challenge matches and high injury rates. Most of my students in the afternoon class were an odd assortment of cops, criminals, bouncers, unemployable thugs, fitness professionals, wannabe fighters and the occasional dominatrix. Brian was so delicate and shy I actually took him aside on a couple of occasions and gave him a speech that he really wasn‚Äôt cut out for this kind of activity and he should find another sport. Yet in time he showed the greatest human attribute of them all - stoic persistence that allows for the incredible forces of adaption over time to work their magic. Despite all my doubts he became the small guy that could twist monsters into pretzels. He went through the MMA phase training with Georges St Pierre and Chris Weidman, the squad grappling phase where he is still a formidable training partner for even the best squad members. He is arguably the single greatest example of the transformative powers of Jiu jitsu training to take anybody from helpless to hardcore. There was scarcely a day in the last two decades where I did not see this remarkable fellow exhibit effortless control over monsters twice his size and strength and then have us all laughing with his New York Jewish humor. They call it the gentle art and Mr Glick was indeed a gentleman and an artist in that domain - he is living proof that you can be too

"Prolonging the action: We all tend to think of Jiu jitsu in terms of moves and the execution of a given move, but against skilled resistance your success or failure will be determined not so much by the execution of any given move but rather your ability to seamlessly INTEGRATE moves together so that a tough opponent who counters the first two or three will be overwhelmed by the fourth. The ability to prolong the action by stringing moves together is a sign that you‚Äôre gaining real jiu jitsu skill. Don‚Äôt execute a move and stop - even as you execute a move be mindful of what comes next and you will soon find that success on the mats finds you more often than before

"Starting up in Boston: My journey into instructional videos at BJJ Fanatics was helped immensely by my good friend and student, Placido Santos @placisantos who proved to be an outstanding demonstration partner (uke) and then student. If ever there was positive proof that instructionals can have a greatly beneficial effect on your game it was this young man. He went from a raw beginner to an excellent competitor and teacher in a very short time working on and from the videos we made together. As his skill level climbed he made regular trips to NYC to train with the squad in the basement, then Puerto Rico and now Austin Texas. The proof of his progress came at the last US ADCC trials where he was one of the outstanding athletes. Now Placido has made his jiu jitsu dreams a reality by opening his own school in the Boston/Westborough area! It is called @5stonesjiujitsu I taught a seminar in Puerto Rico just after the squad broke up to help out the little local school that had hosted us for the year - Placido wowed the local Jiu Jitsu crowd with the excellence of his teaching - I was extremely proud of his performance.

"Speed: Speed is a wonderful attribute in combat sports. In Jiu jitsu it is probably less important than it is in most other combat sports because most of the action is on the floor where speeds are always much slower than standing position. Nonetheless a very quick opponent definitely creates unique problems even in Jiu jitsu. However, what if you aren‚Äôt particularly quick? What are you to do? Understand this - speed of body is great but speed of DECISION MAKING is better. Why? Because if you can make quick mental decisions you can build ANTICIPATION into your game and anticipation will create an artificial speed advantage - not because it makes you faster but because it enables you to START THE RACE EARLIER. If you don‚Äôt have the fast body - TRAIN YOURSELF TO HAVE THE FASTEST MIND THAT CAN IDENTIFY A SITUATION AND MAKE A DECISION BEFORE YOUR OPPONENT HAS STARTED MOVING.
"
"If you can trap an opponents head and arm between your knees, you will immediately be in position to attack the upper body with submissions. The ideal of Jiu jitsu is always to control greater strength and aggression with lesser strength and aggression. There are different ways to express this ideal - but one of the very best is to match the strength of your legs against an opponents arms. This is a battle you can consistently win even against much stronger opponents. A simple and extremely effective way to do this is to clamp your opponents head and one arm between your knees while taking an angle. This opens the door to arm bars, triangles, kimuras, omo plata - even leg locks if you know what you‚Äôre doing. It immediately turns a passive or neutral bottom position into a highly advantageous one - look to get there as often as you can!
"
"If you want to win more - use your feet more! The game of Jiu jitsu is primarily fought with hips legs and feet and only secondarily with shoulders, arms and hands. Make sure always that your training and technique selection reflects this fundamental fact. The more you actively seek to use your feet to connect, move and off balance opponents - the more success you‚Äôll have. We spend the majority of our lives in a hand dominant world - but the world of Jiu jitsu is foot dominant - make sure you play like it
"
"Don‚Äôt tolerate controlling/dangerous grips: Oftentimes in Jiu jitsu you will feel an opponent get a good grip that feels like it controls you in some way that signals danger - a strong passing grip for example. Don‚Äôt accept it - peel it off immediately to deny the advantage. You don‚Äôt want to degenerate into a negative player who only focuses on grip denial at the expense of offense, but still, you have to take care of defensive concerns early before they become insurmountable problems, even if if means backing off the offense for a short time. Here, Georges St Pierre peels a controlling hand that could be setting up a guard pass off his knee - once having done so, he can go back into offense with confidence

"
"Position AND submission: In most cases we distinguish between positional moves and submission moves. Indeed, the old cliche does more than separate them - it puts a sequence between them - position comes BEFORE submission. There are many moves however, that are both submission AND positional moves. Many moves such as juji gatame armbars, kata gatame strangles, variations of triangle strangles, many versions of ashi ashi garami etc that can be used both pin or sweep and opponent and to finish them. These moves are of extraordinary value, since they close the usual gap between position and submission and allow you to work for both at the same time. Make sure you work and train both aspects of the move so that you can derive maximum value from them. Start with the classic arm bar juji gatame. Instead of just trying to extend the arm, challenge yourself to see how long you can pin someone down without extending their arm. Start to see it for what it is - both a pin and a submission. This will make you work the move to its full potential. You‚Äôll need this as you grapple better and better opponents who aren‚Äôt easy to submit - you‚Äôll have an extra element to these moves that‚Äôll keep you ahead of the opposition!
"
"Stance first - action second: Everything in jiu jitsu starts with stance. Before you even establish contact with an opponent you should have your stance set appropriately. For every change in scenario, you‚Äôll have to change to a new stance. STANCE BEFORE EVERYTHING - before contact, before motion, before any given move - there is a stance that makes you efficient and the further you deviate from that ideal stance the less effective and efficient you will be. A huge part of winning in this game is just having the discipline to get into and maintain your stance better than your opponent does. Next time you‚Äôre watching a champion at work - don‚Äôt just watch his MOVES - watch his diligent attention to maintaining a stance and switching from one stance to another as the scenarios unfold - for it is only THIS which makes those moves possible
"
"The incredible power of the hips: We humans are physically very feeble compared with most of the other life forms in this planet, but one thing we do have going for us is the power of the hips. In standing position your hips can be used to block and lift even the heaviest and strongest opponents of you can get your center of gravity underneath theirs. With relatively little energy expenditure you can make even strong and heavy opponents topple and sometimes even fly. The two main choices will always be to get your hips in FRONT of opponents hips or BEHIND. Both offer many great throwing/takedown options. It is crucial you learn to harness the power of your hips. Even though the great majority of takedowns in no gi Jiu jitsu are variations leg tackles, the hips provide an excellent alternative - as well as a powerful counter to those leg tackles on many occasions. Start your training by learning to bend your legs to get your hips under your opponents, then stepping in either in front or behind, being sure not to rise in level in level as you do or it may be you flying over your opponents hips!
"
"Once you develop a strong primary move that opponents fear - it‚Äôs much easier to develop secondary moves that feed off the defensive over reactions you get in response to the primary moves. How successful you are at applying moves is not just a function of how well you execute them - it‚Äôs also heavily affected by show well your opponent responds to them. If they over react to one move, it‚Äôll be a lot easier to breakthrough with a complimentary follow up move. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs so important to have at least one move that opponents know and fear. It functions not only as a bludgeon to break through by itself, but even more importantly, as a provocation that creates over reactions that compromise your opponents ability to defend your other attacking moves.
"
"Follow through: When you go to attack with a joint lock it is important to understand the idea of follow through. To THREATEN a joint you need to EXTEND it. To BREAK a joint, you need to HYPEREXTEND it. This means that you must position yourself in such a way that you can extend the relevant parts of your body THROUGH the opponents joint. Just as a boxer doesn‚Äôt punch AT the jaw, but rather THROUGH the jaw, so to with your joint locks. There must always be some extra extension available for you, so that if you had to, you could have taken the joint beyond it‚Äôs range of motion into damage. Of course it goes without saying that in training you NEVER MAKE USE OF THIS FOLLOW THROUGH DISTANCE as it will injure training partners, but that doesn‚Äôt mean you shouldn‚Äôt be cognizant of it and train yourself to create it should it ever be necessary to use one day.
"
"Dual threats: Creating a threat that your opponent respects is a good thing. Once he recognizes the threat he will be more reserved in his approach to you and more reticent in attacking you. Better yet, however, is to create TWO SIMULTANEOUS THREATS IN OPPOSING DIRECTIONS so that as an opponent tries to counter one he exposes himself to the threat of the other. This means that even if the opponent knows and expects the dual threat he will still have a hard time avoiding it since he can only counter one at a time and that counter leads to the second threat. A good example is leg locking and guard passing. The threat of leg locks forces an opponent to play a conservative guard game with shortened legs and feet conservatively positioned for safety - but this makes the task of passing guard easier. If he plays more creatively with his legs he will be harder to pass, but easier to leg lock. This dual threat makes the bottom players game very difficult. The game of Jiu jitsu is full of these dual threats in all the major positions and scenarios. Make sure you have an at least one per major position and your game will improve dramatically
"
"The real artfulness of Jiu jitsu is in the ability to grapple an opponent with your legs: For the overwhelming majority of people on this planet, they will go through their whole lives using their feet and legs only walking and running. This shows immediately when you ask them to perform other tasks with their legs - they have no experience with using their feet and legs for fine motor skills and they usually fail hopelessly in that activity. This is sad because the human body is vastly stronger and with far greater endurance in the lower body than the upper body. The most efficient use of our body in most activities that require some horsepower is to use the tremendous strength and endurance potential of our legs and hips whenever possible rather than our weak hands and arms. This is especially true in combat sports where you have to take on larger opponents. The day you begin Jiu jitsu training you must make a concerted effort to improve the dexterity and coordination of your feet and legs so that you can incorporate them as much as possible and as early as possible in your grappling training and development. Your Jiu jitsu game will only begin to improve when you switch from being upper body centric as most people are when performing skill tasks - to lower body centric. This fundamental shift is the basis of early development in the Jiu jitsu journey.

"Never underestimate what a simple change of angle and level can do to improve your attack: At any given moment of a match your opponent is making calculations and predictions and what you can and can‚Äôt do based on his observations of your body positioning. He will position himself appropriately based on the beliefs he forms as a result of those observations. All this happens very quickly and changes very quickly as the match unfolds second by second. If you attack from where you currently are you will run directly into the positional roadblocks a good opponent will have put in front of you and get stopped or worse, countered. You need to change angle and level first so that you attack from a direction that your opponent has not blocked and press the attack before he can adapt his positioning to stop the new threat. Level changing in Jiu jitsu has many faces. Here, Gordon Ryan is level changing at the hips in an upwards direction. This, when combined with angle, will create an excellent entry into ashi garami variations and strong leg lock attacks. Next time you want to press the action - don‚Äôt just attack from where you are - change the level of the relevant part of your body (usually hips and head) and angle and THEN attack - you‚Äôll get a lot more success that way

"The return of EBI! The event that gave birth to the squad - Eddie Bravo‚Äôs EBI is about to return this weekend in El Paso, Texas this weekend. It was EBI that launched the original squad into grappling notoriety back when it was Garry Tonon, Eddie Cummings and Gordon Ryan vs the world! They launched the modern leg lock revolution and changed the world of grappling. Now it‚Äôs back in its original form with a stellar cast of new generation athletes! Favorite will be 10th Planet EBI specialist Kyle Boehm who has never lost an EBI event as a black belt and is a master of the rule set. On the other side of the bracket is B Team standout Nicky Rod, fresh off an outstanding silver medal performance at ADCC 2022. He is renowned for his back attacks and ability to escape from anywhere - attributes that are extremely important in EBI tournaments. Team New Wave will enter Giancarlo Bodoni and Luke Griffith. They are relatively inexperienced in the rule set but have been training very hard and have the benefit of the experience and insights of Garry Tonon and Gordon Ryan - the two most successful EBI competitors of all time. There are many other very talented athletes in the mix including ADCC trials winners and IBJJF champions - it‚Äôs going to be real show!!

"Decisions are easier when you work with priorities: Jiu jitsu gives you a thousand possibilities to work with every second. With so many choices available and so little time to make a decision is can be difficult to know which options to commit to. Make it easier for yourself. Make your decisions BEFORE the action. Lay down a set of outcomes in order of desirability and let that ordered list be your decision maker. For me - I have a simple motto that guides the vast majority of decision making in Jiu jitsu - NOTHING BEATS THE BACK - in any situation where I‚Äôm presented by multiple competing options this simple rule makes the decision for me. Then it‚Äôs just a matter of creating a short list of other options arranged in order of desirability to create second, third, fourth and fifth and you‚Äôll immediately have a sense of direction and decisiveness in every jiu jitsu situation
"
"There are many measures of dominance in Jiu jitsu. You have a dominant grip, balance domination, dominant angle, dominant position - but no single situation brings together so many aspects of dominance in grappling as getting behind an opponent. Seek it always. Hunt for it, fight for it - get it. Once you do, the game is so much easier for you and so much harder for your opponent
"
"Elbows: Next time you‚Äôre struggling for offensive ideas against a tough opponent, consider this - IF YOU EVER GET OUTSIDE AN OPPONENTS ELBOW, YOU WILL ALWAYS GAIN AT THE VERY LEAST AN ADVANTAGEOUS ANGLE AND QUITE POSSIBLY ACCESS TO HIS BACK AS WELL. Learning to get past your opponents elbows is a huge part of the game. You should several effective methods to quickly slip past an opponents elbow and get to an outside angle and threaten the back. This will create a situation where opponents will either risk having their back taken if they don‚Äôt respond adequately, or if they do respond, their response will inevitably create fine attacking opportunities on the opposite side as they are preoccupied with recovering angle, they won‚Äôt have the time and focus to defend the new direction of attack. Drags, elbow posts, ducks, slidebys - they all are based on the notion of beating your opponents elbow and as a result, create angle and back exposure that pays handsome dividends in Jiu jitsu. Make sure you threaten getting past your opponents elbows as often as possible - it‚Äôs a low risk, high reward pathway to more effective offense in Jiu jitsu

"Hands: Your hands and feet are your primary connectors to your opponents body. The hands are by themselves weak, but they enable you to connect to an opponent so that you can use the stronger parts of your body to provide the horsepower required to control strong people. In short, no hands, no connection. No connection, no ability to control an opponent. Once you understand this you will see the value of consistently fighting against your opponents hands as you grapple. If you can control his hands you control his primary connectors. If he can‚Äôt connect strongly to you, he can‚Äôt control you. So get used to monitoring and controlling your opponents hands, especially when you‚Äôre in positional trouble. It‚Äôs often quite easy and simple to do, and can save you a lot of grief during tough matches.

"When it‚Äôs time to go - go! Speed is a wonderful thing in combat sports, if you have it, god bless you, but if you don‚Äôt, rest assured that the race doesn‚Äôt necessarily go to the fastest - but to the one who STARTS FIRST. Speed won‚Äôt do you any good if you are indecisive. A slower player can get to a destination first if he starts first and doesn‚Äôt hesitate when the opportunity arises. A fast athlete can end up in second place to the desired destination if he is indecisive when it‚Äôs time to go. You don‚Äôt have to be the fastest person in the gym in jiu jitsu, but you should strive to be the fastest decision maker and once a decision is made, the fastest to act on it - that will more than atone for any lack of physical speed you may have
"
"Finding your moves: Jiu jitsu gives you a huge array of moves to choose from - far more than you could ever hope to master in one lifetime. This means you must choose which you shall focus on - and those choices will define your jiu jitsu. Sometimes you‚Äôll be shown a move and the first time you try it it feels like a natural fit for you. Other times you‚Äôll try a new move and it feels like it just doesn‚Äôt suit you. Sometimes you can work through those initial feelings that this move is not meant for you and through hard work and perseverance make it an effective part of your arsenal. Sometimes if a move feels inherently awkward, just put it on the shelf for a while. I‚Äôve seen athletes reject a move out of hand on first meeting, then several years later when they were in a different place mentally and physically try the same move a second time and felt it was now something they could feel as a natural fit for their game. If a move doesn‚Äôt come naturally to you, don‚Äôt discard it completely and immediately - let time work it‚Äôs magic either by working and studying hard to improve your performance or by playing a waiting game and trying it again in the future  when you‚Äôve changed a little. Remember however, that you don‚Äôt have to excel in every move - only enough to be effective against your opponents, so don‚Äôt be afraid to put moves on the shelf if you‚Äôve given them an honest try but it just feels unnatural to you. Finding a balance between acceptance, rejection and investing time and work into projects that initially show little promise can be a tricky business. Don‚Äôt despair - time will almost always reveal the correct answer
"
"This is a sport where your performance of one of your favorite moves can be dramatically increased in a very short by the addition of just useful piece of information - always keep an open mind and a desire to learn more and you‚Äôll rarely get stuck in performance plateaus
"
"Sometimes there‚Äôs a lot going on when it seems like there‚Äôs nothing going on:  A strange thing about jiu jitsu is that there can be periods where the two athletes seem inactive, but underneath both are engaged in a tight contest for advantage that few can see even though it‚Äôs all happening in front of them. It is very much a sport only those who‚Äôve spent a lot of time in similar situations can understand that both are vying for advantage even though it appears to the casual observer that nothing is happening. Sometimes can be something like a battle for inside head position, or top hand position - elements that don‚Äôt look like much but which have a big impact on who will dominate the next scoring exchange. Learning to see the importance of these small battles within a larger war is a good sign of your technical progress. Remember always that Jiu jitsu is like life - the quality of your start in any endeavor has a big impact on the degree of difficulty of a successful finish - so don‚Äôt be afraid to take your time in these seemingly inactive periods - establish your advantage first and THEN go into the big moves.
"
"When it comes time to carry the weight of your opponent it is not the strength of your muscles that is most important, but rather, the strength of your STANCE. Whatever degree of functional strength you bring to the scenario you‚Äôre engaged in will always be proportional to the strength of your stance. Perfect your stance for all the major scenarios you can expect to find yourself in in a match, learn to move well from one stance to another in accordance with the unfolding action - and you‚Äôll always feel stronger than you look!!
"
"When you‚Äôve got a simple goal‚Ä¶Very often Jiu jitsu requires us to enter into fast and complex scrambles where it‚Äôs hard to know what to do because there are so many variables and so little time to figure things out. My advice is this: play scrambles with a few simple heuristics - simple rules of thumb that give you a CLEAR SENSE OF DIRECTION in the most confusing scrambles. Here, Georges St Pierre and his partner are in fast motion. There are good possibilities for both athletes. From Georges‚Äô perspective the heuristic KEEP YOUR OPPONENTS HIPS BETWEEN YOUR KNEES gives clear and concise advise that will direct him through the scramble and allow him to finish in winning position. The more complex and dynamic the situation - the more valuable simple and effective rules become for guidance.
"
"When you‚Äôre close to a win you‚Äôve got two options - speed or control: There are quite often situations in Jiu jitsu where you are close to total victory - say for example, when you are starting to apply a rear strangle, or when you have an opponent totally immobilized in a tight ashi garami with the heel exposed - or in this case with Georges St Pierre, a locked in arm bar. Your basic choice now is this - you can either rush to apply the finishing move and get it completed before the opponent can get himself defensively organized, or, you can take your time and control your opponents movement so that you can make adjustments and even multiple finishing attempts over time to get the breakthrough. Both can work. As a general rule, however, I favor the control option. My reasoning is that speed options are almost always more likely to injure students in training and time lost in training makes victory in competition less likely. More importantly, speed creates momentum and looseness that can be used by a crafty opponent to aid an escape. Unfortunately the speed options almost always prevent you switching the a second or third attack option because everything is put into the quick application of the first attempt. Control methods allow multiple attempt and combination attacks that tend to do better at the higher levels. Speed attempts tend to work well up to a certain level or not work at all. You need to be able to apply both, as you may be attempting the move with very little time left on the clock or in a rule set that gives very limited time to attack (eg Judo), but if time is available, make sure you can work at controlled pace that enables you solve any puzzles the opponent presents to you, work through multiple attacks and variations before getting to the finish

"ADCC 2022: Counting down the training days for the biggest event in grappling. Teams from around the world are making their final preparations for the big show. Looking at the athlete roster for this year I must say I have never seen anything close to the level of talent in any previous ADCC event. In the old days of ADCC the first round were usually mismatches that enabled the favorite to advance with minimal stress. In this event even the lowest seed athletes are outright killers who could easily upset even established champions. I am certain this year will see some of these unknown athletes emerge as new legends. I am thrilled at the growth of this sport - this event is going to show that growth in two ways - the audience and the athletes. Looking forward to seeing you there!

"Guard passing without a gi: The single most common activity from top position in Jiu jitsu is passing guard - the act of getting past your opponents legs into dominant pins where no part of your opponents legs intervene between your upper body and his upper body. By removing your opponents legs from the equation you shut out the vast majority of his attacking options and open up your own attacking options. When it comes time to pass an opponents guard with no gi my favorite methodology by far is to use standard methods of passing as a distraction and in the ensuing passing vs retention battle - DROP INTO YOUR OPPONENTS HALF GUARD IN A CHEST TO CHEST POSITION AND PASS FROM THERE. The great advantage of this method is that it enables you to control your opponents head PRIOR to passing, as opposed to most passing methods that ask you to pass first and control the head last. This prior head control takes away much of the confusing high paced scrambling that besets most no gi passing methods. Next time you‚Äôre struggling to get control of and pass slippery and dynamic opponents without a gi - drop into half guard and let that chest to chest head control work in your favor!

"Victory in Dallas! Luke Griffith won a beautiful victory over ADCC sensation Haisam Rida in just 24 seconds with a devastating heel hook. It is testimony to Mr Griffiths incredible learning development that in just eight months of training with us and starting with no leg lock game at all - he is now heel hooking one of the top athletes in the game. Great work Luke Griffith! @luke_griffithjj That was a very fine heel hook! Congratulations also to Ethan Crelinsten on the biggest win of his career so far with a great stranglehold win over Brazilian sensation Fabricio Andrey and also to the rising phenom Cole Abate who at 17 years of age already looks like a world beater! Hope you all enjoyed the show!
"
"Threat level: The highest goal of jiu jitsu is submission. The reality however, is that most of your opponents know all the major submission holds and how to defend them. As a result, the majority of submission attempts you ever attempt will fail. Don‚Äôt worry - that‚Äôs ok - remember - you only need ONE to succeed and the match is yours. Understand something however - your submissions will only have a decisive effect on the match if your opponent fears the consequences of no tapping to them. If your submissions are MECHANICALLY WEAK, they will be ignored and even countered by a good opponent. If they are strong, opponents will quickly submit, or over react to the threat and create easy follow up attacks for you. It‚Äôs important them, that your submissions carry with them the threat of damage if the opponent doesn‚Äôt tap. Just as there is a massive difference between someone throwing light slaps at you versus something throwing heavy blows with the intention of knocking you out cold, so too there is a massive difference between grappling someone whose submission attempts feel like they would do little damage even if you let them perform it versus a submission specialist who feels like he could tear your limbs apart or strangle you unconscious in seconds. In the latter case, you will want to tap quickly or react so dramatically that you‚Äôll open up vulnerabilities just trying to get away from the initial threat. Make sure your submissions have that mechanical strength underlying them so that in a real situation you know they are capable of doing real damage if the situation should demand it. Of course in daily training apply all submissions with care and control so that you don‚Äôt hurt training partners, but practice your mechanics so you on that day you need the power of real submission, you have that ability. Remember that AN EMPTY THREAT IS NO THREAT AT ALL.
"
"There are an infinite number of possibilities in a scramble - but there should be only one goal - the opponents back: It can be hard to know what to do in the fleeting time and motion of a scrambles. The single most useful thing you can have under these circumstances is A SENSE OF DIRECTION. You can actually go in several good directions in a scramble, but in my opinion the best direction will always be towards your opponents back. The back is a big target, a huge percentage of our body‚Äôs surface area, so it will always be available at some point as you move through a prolonged scramble. Once you get there it enables you to control and finish the toughest opponents. When your world is a confusing tangle of limbs flying around the mat - keep your thought process simple and clear - AIM FOR THE BACK. Here, Gordon Ryan does exactly that at the ADCC world championships. He is a fine example showing you don‚Äôt need to the fastest athlete to be a superb scrambler - just an athlete with a good sense of direction. Remember, in a race between a speedster with no sense of direction versus a plodder who knows exactly where he wants to go - the plodder will beat the speedster every time
"
"Your strength is in your stance: It‚Äôs good to be strong. Strength helps almost every aspect of combat sports. Understand however, that your greatest source of strength in a match is not from your muscles but from your stance. Show me the strongest man in the room and make him perform in a poor stance and I‚Äôll show you a man who gets manhandled by smaller, weaker opponents who hold a strong stance. In addition that strong man will quickly get exhausted as he compensates for failures in stance with muscular strength. If you want to increase your mat strength, your first step is to improve your stance. Understand that for all the major positions of Jiu jitsu there is an appropriate stance. If you‚Äôre just beginning Jiu jitsu and you have no clue what constitutes a good stance in a given position I suggest you watch footage of great champions in competition or even in training and watch not for the flashy elements, or who wins and who loses, as most people do, but rather, focus on observing their STANCE and try to replicate what you see. A well set stance maintained over the course of a match and adapting appropriately to every rapid change of position will give you greater improvements in mat strength and endurance than any attempt to add strength to your muscles alone

"Jiu jitsu with Mr Tom Hardy: The team had a blast training the last two days with the great English actor Tom Hardy, who is also a talented jiu jitsu player!! Mr Hardy is here with some of his British  friends. Mr Hardy does truly great work helping the welfare of former soldiers coming back from war into civilian life through the @reorgcharity foundation. Jiu jitsu is often useful as a means of getting soldiers back together in a healthy environment that builds the old camaraderie they had in a civilian setting and can help smooth the transition back home. I‚Äôve always been a fan of Mr Hardy‚Äôs cinematic work after Georges St Pierre, who was obsessed with The Batman movie in which the Caped Crusader takes on arch villain Bane (played by Mr Hardy), used to quote endlessly from the movie during fight camps!

"Push and pull: Every grappling exchange has a beginning based around establishing grip. Once that is attained it‚Äôs natural to want to go straight into your attacks. That can certainly work, but often you are well advised to start with a brief period of PUSH and PULL that creates the possibility of ACTION and REACTION. Learning to play constructively with those reactions to your pushing and pulling is one of the biggest steps you can make in your grappling journey. Next time you lock up with your partner, don‚Äôt rush to your moves. Start with a brief period of push and pull using both arms and legs and try to feed of the reactions you get and use those reactions to enter your moves. Adding that intermediary step of push and pull - no matter how brief - will add a whole new dimension of attacking skills to your game

"The path to powerful arm bars is through the head and shoulders: Ostensibly the juji gatame arm bar is an attack on the ELBOW. After all, that‚Äôs what will actually break if the opponent refuses to submit. However, your ability to control a tough resisting opponent long enough and well enough to get to that breaking point is mostly bound up with your ability to dominate his HEAD AND SHOULDERS. In the use of arm bars from bottom position in particular,  you must be able to take your opponents head into an unnatural position that thoroughly undermines his ability to stack his weight into you and blunt your attack. Use the crossface leg - the one that goes over the head - to curl back in such a way that his head is taken completely out of alignment. This makes effective resistance very difficult indeed. As is so often the case in Jiu jitsu, you have to win several preliminary battles in order to win the major battle. In this case, the head before the elbow.

"Ethan Crelinsten wins EBI Overtime event! Outstanding squad junior Ethan Crelinsten, one of our Canadian representatives, out in a near flawless performance last night to win the new EBI overtime event, a new version of EBI that only uses the distinctive overtime period of the old EBI competition format as the basis of the event. In the old EBI there was a ten minute submission only regulation period. If there was no submission the two athletes went into overtime with a choice of starting either on the back or juji gatame arm bar position. This was an exciting and viewer friendly format that proved very popular and was an excellent way to showcase the leg lock revolution that changed the face of submission grappling. I was always very proud of the fact that the three senior squad students, Garry Tonon, Eddie Cummings and Gordon Ryan, all achieved the remarkable feat of submitting all their opponents in regulation time on the way to their victories (I think Garry May have done it twice). Eddie Bravo shelved the old format in favor of combat Jiu Jitsu but recently brought in the idea of overtime competition. I think the idea was that Many athletes now simply stall in the regulation time with the intention of winning in overtime, so the idea was to cut to the chase and go from the start where it was likely to end up. Our back attack system is very well suited to EBI overtime format and Mr Crelinsten showed the depth of his knowledge training in this very unforgiving position - he won three of four match via strangle and won the final decisively on riding time. It was a great performance and shows well the spirit of training hard to reach for ever higher goals - well done Ethan!!

"What are you known for on the mat? In everyday life I am sure you are known by those around you to have a certain image of personality that is distinctively yours and which makes you recognizable to them. For example, you might be known as someone who likes fashion, or cars, or fishing or some activity or point of view that characterizes you. One of the most important elements in your development in Jiu jitsu is to develop your own Jiu jitsu image or personality that characterizes your Jiu jitsu game. Once you have this people will have certain expectations about you on the mat. YOU CAN EXPLOIT THESE EXPECTATIONS TO ADVANTAGE. If you are known as a dangerous back attack specialist, opponents will be very reticent about exposing their back to you. This will usually create defensive over reactions that you can use to win. If they focus on turning to face you to prevent back exposure, they will be easier to attack with guillotines, Darce and anaconda strangles. If they glue their back to the ground defensively, they will be very vulnerable to north/south strangles etc etc. Your image and reputation is important in this regard. It will influence how people behave around you, and their behavior will be predictable based on what you know about what they believe - and that is exploitable! So - what are you known for on the mat?

"One of the biggest inhibitors of progress in Jiu jitsu is a disproportionate preference for either top or bottom position at the expense of the other. Only when you see them as complimentary parts of a whole will your game have the uninterrupted flow required for great Jiu jitsu performance
"
"Your legs vs his head: One of the basic features of Jiu jitsu is the notion of controlling greater strength and aggression with lesser strength and aggression via mechanical and tactical advantage. One of the surest ways to do this is to use the strongest parts of the human body (legs and hips) against the weaker parts (head and shoulders for example). Two excellent examples of this would be the triangle and juji gatame arm bar - both of which directly match your legs against an opponents head and arm. Whenever possible look for this kind of match up in your favor. IF YOU ARE TO DEFEAT BIGGER AND STRONGER OPPONENTS THEN YOU MUST SEEK TO FIGHT YOUR OPPONENTS UPPER BODY WITH YOUR LOWER BODY AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. If you make it a battle of your upper body against a similarly skilled and bigger opponents upper body it is unlikely you will win. MAKE IT A FIGHT BETWEEN YOUR LOWER BODY AND HIS UPPER BODY AND VICTORY WILL FIND A PATH TO YOUR DOOR OFTEN.
"
"When you‚Äôre starting on the path to back control mastery - focus on the upper body first: The back is the most dominant position in a grappling match without striking. Nothing else creates such a mismatch between the control and submission opportunities of the attacker vs the defender. The SCORE comes from the legs - getting your two legs hooked into an opponents hips is what creates the score. However, the real world control comes from maintaining chest to back connection with or without the legs. When you first begin the back game - focus on the upper body connection first and foremost. You can always get the hooks in later to score. Use your arms in seatbelt or double under control to form a tight initial connection and create a strangle threat. As you get more advanced you‚Äôll find there are ways you can get legs in first without conventional upper body connection but they aren‚Äôt the best place to start since you‚Äôll be using those far less than conventional methods. Here, Gordon Ryan, a true master of back control, uses a safety first upper body connection to secure himself in a winning position, knowing that once this is done, getting the legs in later will be relatively easy
"
"The more dominant your grips and position - the more you take your time when moving: Sometimes Jiu jitsu rewards us for moving quickly - usually when we don‚Äôt have any form of advantage over our opponent. In these cases an advantage in speed may be the only advantage you have and if you can get to the next position ahead of your opponent you can profit. Sometimes Jiu jitsu rewards use for being slow. This is usually when you have a dominant grip and (usually top) position. In these cases time is your friend. Time spent in these positions is tiring and frustrating for an opponent. As he works harder and harder to get out, the more risks he will have to take to escape and the more likely he will leave a limb behind to be taken. So next time you take a dominating position/grip - take your time! Don‚Äôt be in such a rush for your next move. Remember that WHEN YOU HAVE NO CONTROL TIME IS YOUR ENEMY - BUT WHEN YOU HAVE CONTROL - TIME IS YOUR FRIEND
"
"Smooth: The single biggest differentiator between skilled and unskilled athletes on the mat is the degree of effect in the application of moves versus the amount of effort expended to get that effect. Great athletes have a way of getting more done with less. Their game has an effortless look to it that stands out in a sea of lesser athletes who struggle mightily to gain little. When you drill seek to get the maximum effect with the least effort. That doesn‚Äôt mean being a limp rag doll. Sometimes the minimum effort required is still quite considerable - it just means being as economical as circumstances allow - and very often that allow you to be MUCH more economical than most believe. It all starts with mindset. Smooth it out. Aspire to economical grace - in time this demeanor will spread from your drilling to your sparring - and that‚Äôs when real progress starts. This is Nicholas Meregali doing creativity drills one day before his victory at the IBJJF Grand Prix where he defeated three jiu jitsu monsters back to back. When you are matched against the best you‚Äôll need that smooth efficiency
"
"Going beyond pinning: The basic theme of Jiu jitsu is of getting to dominant upper body pins to gain positional advantage. To actually SUBMIT someone however, you‚Äôll need to do more than pin them - YOU WILL NEED TO ISOLATE A LIMB. Learning to isolate and control a limb from a dominant pin is the bridge between position and submission. Whenever you get to a pin in training don‚Äôt be satisfied with the points you‚Äôve scored. Go further and isolate a limb - that is the only way you will be able to submit opponents.
"
"Getting pinned is bad - getting pinned AND getting your limbs extended out and away from your torso is even worse: When most people get to a dominant pin they are so happy to score the points that they don‚Äôt take the next step and seek to isolate a limb by working it out and away from the torso. Never forget that the ultimate aim of grappling (not fighting)  is to submit an opponent. A positional pin is a means to that end - only when you take the extra step of limb isolation will you bridge the gap between position and submission. Next time you get to a dominant pin, don‚Äôt be satisfied with the pin - go further and work the limb away from the torso - you will find immediately that you make the pin stronger and suddenly become far more threatening to your opponent. Best of all you will start submitting a lot more opponents
"
"Make your opponent carry your weight whenever you can. Try also to make sure that when he carries your weight, he does so in a mechanically inefficient way so that he has to use muscles to carry the weight rather than sound structure/stance. This will tire him quickly. If you can make this a habit you‚Äôll quickly fatigue opponents and a tired opponent is much easier to control and submit

Two very talented students who began training with us here in Austin areLuke Griffith  @luke_griffithjj and Reese LaFever @reeseis_bjj Both won gold in their respective weight divisions, Luke at Brown belt and Reese at Purple belt - both won every match by submission!

"
"Reading your opponent: So we often we approach a match with a predetermined idea of what we want to do - there‚Äôs nothing wrong with that - but don‚Äôt let that make you oblivious to what your opponent is doing. It behooves you to always read your opponent so you gain information of what he is trying to do so that you can first negate and then capitalize on his intentions. The second you put your hands on your opponent you can read his level of physical tension and what direction his body wants to move. USE THIS ABILITY. It‚Äôs like a a different form of vision and one that gives you real insight into your opponents game. It‚Äôs much easier to beat someone when you know what they want to do. The best scenario is one where you know what YOU want to do and also what your OPPONENT wants to do - when you know both you‚Äôll be very difficult to defeat
"
"The battle for elbows: One of the strongest positions that the human body can hold is your elbow held right to your hip. This creates a very strong structure that an opponent will find extremely difficult to dislodge. The further your elbow drifts away from your hip - the weaker your arm becomes overall. A big part of grappling then, is the battle to create conditions where your arms are in a strong position close to your hips whilst your opponents elbows are in a weak position extended away from his hips. If you can reliably create this circumstance, you‚Äôll have a very considerable physical advantage over your opponent. Under hooks are one great way to make this happen, as you can see here as Nicholas Meregali works hard to pull an opponents elbow out and away from his hips to create openings for his famous attacking open guard game. Always look for opportunities to get an opponents arm extended while keeping your own retracted - you‚Äôll feel strong to your opponent and be in a great position to attack!
"
"The mix of positional and submission skills is best: Positional skills are the working basis of Jiu jitsu, but submissions are the goal. That dichotomy makes many athletes create a game that tends to focus on one to the exclusion of the other - but this is not the way. Only when you can seamlessly go from one to the other will you maximize your jiu jitsu potential. Let POSITIONAL skills create the PRESSURE that create opportunities for SUBMISSION skills and you will have a formidable game that few will be able to stop. Here, Giancarlo Bodoni shows exactly this theme with a fine mix of positional pressure that creates a defensive overreaction in a tough and skilled opponent that sets up an unexpected submission opportunity. Develop your game with this unity between position and submission and you‚Äôll go far.
"
"Dual threats: We always talk about position and submission as though it is either/or; but in truth at the higher levels it‚Äôs the simultaneous threat of both together that usually creates the breakthrough you seek. When you‚Äôre behind an opponent and want to secure scoring position - threaten the strangle - your opponent will become forgetful of defending the rear mount when he‚Äôs battling for his life against submission and you‚Äôll likely score. When you can get the strangle set in place - threaten the position - make him fight against the placement of your hooks, he‚Äôll become forgetful of the strangle danger as he becomes preoccupied with defending rear mount, and that‚Äôs when you‚Äôll sink the strangle. Two threats - attack with one will make any opponent forgetful of the other - and that‚Äôs when you‚Äôll get your goal
"
"Getting ready: Nicholas Meregali getting ready for his upcoming match at @ufcfightpass grappling event next week. He has been making great progress in developing his no gi skills but he is facing a truly formidable opponent - the great Roberto Cyborg Abreau - one of the premier No gi champions of this era. The event will be in Las Vegas and features a tournament  with many outstanding athletes such as Wagner Rocha, Roberto Jimenez, Felipe Andrew, Daniel Manasoiu, Gabriel Arges and two time ADCC finalist Nicky Rod and several super fights including one with teenage phenom Helena Crevar with main event being the titanic match between Craig Jones and Felipe Pena!

"Gripping from guard is very different from most scenarios: When people talk about gripping skills they usually mean gripping with the HANDS. In fact in Jiu jitsu we can play guard position with four limbs not two. You will be expected to form connection with hand AND feet. All your life you have learned to contour your hand to maximize grip. Now you must learn the same again with your feet. The key is to CONTOUR your feet around the target - just as you do with your hands. If you want to PULL with your feet, we generally use your shoelaces and retract our toes. If you want to PUSH - use the sole of the foot. Learning to grip Qi the tour feet from guard is one of the first skills that pertains to the Jiu jitsu game
"
"Bringing some Judo back into Jiu jitsu: When most Jiu jitsu players look to improve their standing skills they look to wrestling for inspiration. There are good reasons for this. Wrestling is of course practiced without a gi, so the grip fighting and controls translate much more readily than judo, which is practiced in a gi. In addition, most people find the leg tackles that dominate wrestling generally easier and faster to learn than the foot and hip takedowns that are the mainstays of judo. Thirdly, wrestling is much more culturally dominant here in the US than judo is, so there are many more people to teach it, the standard is typically much higher (compare the number of Olympic medals American wrestlers have won versus American Judoka) and it is much more accessible to students. Nonetheless I am a big advocate of the great value of judo skills adapted to no gi Jiu jitsu and constantly get my students to use them whenever possible. The close upper body contact that is used to initiate most judo throws means that after the throw is completed you usually have a much better position to control scrambles than you do when using leg tackles and also makes it more difficult for opponents to counter your  takedowns with upper body submissions. Too many people see wrestling and judo as an either/or choice as the basis of their No Gi standing skills and too many dismiss judo  as too time consuming to learn - study them both and use them both - your standing game will benefit immensely. Here, 2022 ADCC Gold Medalist Giancarlo Bodoni launches the previous world champion with a beautiful foot sweep that merges sasae tsuri komi ashi with de ashi harai after defending an initial leg tackle that demonstrates well the possibilities of interplay between judo and wrestling skills
"
"Guard passing - two directions for your game:  There are a vast number of ways to pass an opponents guard, but at the end of the day they can be divided into two camps. The first are those passes that focus upon USING YOUR MOBILITY TO OUTFLANK YOUR OPPONENTS LEGS. The second are those that focus upon IMMOBILIZING YOUR OPPONENTS FEET AND HIPS AND GOING PAST HIS IMMOBILIZED HIPS. So one is concerned with using your mobility to pass, the other is concerned with restricting the opponents mobility. Toreando (bullfighting) passes are a good example of using your mobility advantage (you are on your feet, opponent is on his back so you should be able to move much faster and more freely than him). Bodylock passes would be a good example of passes that shut down your opponents hips and feet and prevent him following your movement as you pass. It‚Äôs natural that you should favor one type over the other, BUT MAKE SURE YOU HAVE AT LEAST ONE OF EACH (and preferably a few more than that) so that you can play both games to throw off difficult opponents. Here, Gordon Ryan puts his opponent under tremendous pressure with his powerful body lock passing style
"
"Where you‚Äôre strong and where you‚Äôre weak: As long as your elbows are tight to your torso and pointing down towards your hips, your arms will feel very strong - even if you aren‚Äôt normally considered a strong person. As soon as your elbows are taken out of position over your shoulders and away from the torso and pointing away from the hips - you will feel weak even if normally you‚Äôre considered a very strong person. What we call strength on the mat is mostly due to stance and positioning. What we perceive as weakness is most due to failures or imperfections in stance and positioning. The goal in Jiu jitsu then, is always to break an opponent‚Äôs stance and take them out of position so that knees and elbows are extended away from the torso and neck turned or tilted; whilst at the same time preserving your own stance and positioning. Raw strength is a good thing, but it can be greatly increased by stance and positioning and greatly decreased by the destruction of these
"
"You don‚Äôt have to be fast if you know how to slow the other guy down. Your speed is largely determined by genetics and diminishes with age - but your ability to slow another person down through body positioning has no limit - focus on that more than increasing your own speed.

"Fight them with your legs: One of the most fundamental aspects of Jiu jitsu is it‚Äôs philosophy of always seeking to match your legs against your opponent‚Äôs arms whenever possible. All the best positions and submissions in Jiu jitsu involve you connecting your legs to your opponent‚Äôs upper body to take advantage of the fact that the human body has a basic asymmetry between upper body strength and endurance versus lower body strength and endurance. If you can consistently match your lower body against an opponents upper body you‚Äôll have a great advantage even when you‚Äôre smaller than your opponent. Make it your mission to always lead with your legs and you‚Äôll go far in this game!

"Victory in Austin!! The New Wave team had an outstanding performance here in Austin Texas at the WNO grappling event hosted by @flograppling Teenage phenom @helenajiujitsugirl Helena Crevar won via heel hook vs talented Australian Healy Dayan. Oliver Taza @tazagarami continued his impressive form winning a hard fought match against a rival from a higher weight division who had defeated him twice in the past. In the main event Nicholas Meregali @nicholasmeregali took on the great two time ADCC champion Kaynan Duarte of ATOS. It was truly a clash of titans. We have always considered ATOS our toughest rivals and Kaynan one of the Uber elite grapplers of the world. After a strong early offensive Mr Duarte won the initial exchanges but Mr Meregali came back strong and ultimately took down, passed mounted and finished with a superbly applied kata gatame stranglehold for an epic victory. This was truly one of the most impressive performances of Nicholas Meregali‚Äôs career and showed the incredible progress he has made in no gi Jiu jitsu in a very short time. To do this  against such a great man as Mr Duarte was truly impressive. There were many other great performances tonight with very impressive victories to grappling legends Ffion Davies, Dante Leon, Felipe Pena and Nicky Ryan to round out a truly great night of grappling! I had the pleasure of seeing my sensei Renzo Gracie @renzograciebjj who was in Austin for the show - it was wonderful seeing him again - thank you always Renzo for your guidance over the years and the great start you gave me and all your students. Hope you all enjoyed the show!!

"Proactive and reactive mindsets: Traditional jiu jitsu was centered around a reactive mindset where you let an opponent take the initiative and you capitalized on mistakes he made during the match. In very long matches against less experienced opponents this works very well. In modern jiu jitsu with shorter duration and very well trained opponents there is generally a push towards a proactive mindset where you initiate and get an opponent following your lead. In truth there have been great champions using both methods, so I believe it‚Äôs wrong to try to say one approach is inherently superior to the other. Try to develop both aspects into your game. When you are matched against much bigger and stronger opponents the reactive approach may well be better. As you age the reactive approach often gets better results. The proactive is best when you are matched evenly in size and skill. Ultimately you‚Äôll need both to fully develop your game, though it‚Äôs natural that your personality will determine which of the two you favor - aggressive confident athletes typically favor the proactive approach and less assertive, patient or Underdog mentality types typically favor the reactive approach. So develop both, but recognize that you‚Äôll probably favor one over the other, but that different circumstances and advancing age may change your mind as to which you‚Äôd rather make use of
"
"One of the great powers of the mount position - asphyxiation: Pins are part of the heart and soul of jiu jitsu. The whole point of jiu jitsu is to attain its two most powerful pins - mount and rear mount - and use the pressure they generate to submit even the toughest opponents. One of the great advantages of the mounted position over all other pins is that it aligns your body in a position where you can attack your opponents BREATHING. This massively increases the amount of pressure you can bring to bear on an opponent - pressure that breaks wills and forces them to make errors they‚Äôd normally never make. Here Giancarlo Bodoni @giancarlobodoni shows the kind of severe pressure possible from the mounted position as he wins gold in the finals of the Enigma Grappling show in Austin last night over a very tough opponent who himself submitted all his opponents en route to the finals. Breathing is the single most basic necessity for life - when it‚Äôs taken from you you can‚Äôt ignore it. This is one of the features of the mounted position that makes it such a powerful weapon in jiu jitsu without striking. Establish the position, attack the ability to breath, and the finishes will come, whether by asphyxiation or submission hold.

"Leandro Lo was unquestionably one of the greatest Jiu jitsu athletes of his generation and indeed in the history of the sport. Eight times he stood on top of the Jiu jitsu world, most recently at the 2022 IBJJF World Championships. As an athlete he excelled in all the major aspects of the game, as a man he was friendly and animated, one of the great social characters of the game and an unforgettable character. He was able to keep a rare balance in his life between athletic excellence at the highest levels but at the same time able to indulge his other passions in life. It‚Äôs easy on the path to greatness in sports to get so obsessive that you ignore every other facet of life. Leandro was able to remain at the top across multiple weight divisions for over a decade but still live a full and fun life outside of jiu jitsu that made him one of the great characters of the game. His death is a reminder of the delicate nature of life and how all our plans and dreams have to kept within the bounds of our mortality, for we never know the day or hour of our end and there is no denying the iron decrees of fate. Leandro made jiu jitsu better and he enriched the lives of all who knew him - there is no better life than that. Camus said it best ‚Äúthose whom the gods love most die young.‚Äù You can kill a man but you can‚Äôt kill the memories of him - the jiu jitsu world will always remember him as one of its very best and most loved in its pantheon.
"
"If you can clearly articulate the problem - it‚Äôs usually easy to find a solution: The only truly unsolvable problems in jiu jitsu are those where you don‚Äôt identify it as a problem - and as a result you never even begin looking for a solution. Just as bad is a situation where you fail to identify the problem accurately and look for solutions to the wrong problem, or a pseudo problem or a part of a problem. Always have a very clear understanding of two essential questions 
WHAT EXACTLY AM I TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH?
And
WHAT ARE THE MAIN OBSTACLES THAT MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO ACCOMPLISH THESE GOALS?
If you keep a healthy focus on these two questions, you will find it much easier to create effective solutions to the obstacles that hold you back. THE FIRST STEP TO FINDING A SOLUTION IS ASKING THE RIGHT QUESTION. Know what you want to do and know what stands in your way and you‚Äôll have a better chance getting the question right from the start.

"For many Jiu jitsu students the strongest motivation to learn takedowns has nothing to do with the recreational sport they play - after all, you can just sit to guard every time you play if you wish - it‚Äôs the realization that in a self defense situation that‚Äôs not an option. Accordingly, this is not a subject matter that can be completely overlooked by Jiu jitsu students - at some point it has to be addressed.
"
"Strangles are almost always the better option: Submission is the soul of Jiu jitsu. There are two types of submission hold in the sport - joint locks and strangles. Both are essential to the game and your development, but if you have a choice - in most cases, go with strangles. Strangles have a greater degree of certainty associated with them. A courageous and determined opponent can simply refuse to submit to a joint lock if he is willing to take the damage, but refusal to tap to a strangle won‚Äôt affect the outcome - even the bravest opponent will simply pass out. In addition, there is something intrinsically better about a method of ending a match that is less damaging to an opponent. A strangle causes no lasting damage if applied within the rules of the game - a joint lock on the other hand often causes damage. Strangles are more gentle in application and result (unless of course applied with bad intentions outside the sport). Jiu jitsu expects you to train toward mastery of both - but if fate should ever give you choice between them - bet on strangles over joint locks in most cases

"Victory in Connecticut!! Neiman Gracie won a brilliant victory tonight via flawless inside heel hook over MMA legend Jon Fitch at BELLATOR MMA in the Mohegan Sun arena. It was a shockingly dominant performance over such a great opponent - Neiman scored with takedowns and fisticuffs and showed his very dangerous submission arsenal in a truly well rounded performance. It was a great pleasure for me to corner next to my sensei Renzo Gracie and Jamie Crowder, who provided excellent tactical advice and coaching through a long and difficult camp with interruptions due to injury and the Covid crises. Neiman showed his ability to attack the whole body with submissions and strikes while controlling the direction of the fight. It was a true honor also to witness the retirement of Jon Fitch - an athlete I have admired for many years and who was undeniably one of the greatest welterweights of his generation. I still remember getting Georges St Pierre ready to battle him years ago and have always admired his ability and character. For Neiman to perform so well against such a great man is testimony to his growth and development. Hope you all enjoyed the show!!

"Combining two moves into one: One well applied jiu jitsu can be a real threat - when two moves are combined into one the threat can become overwhelming. Arguably the best move when it comes to co-joining moves is the triangle. Once you lock a triangle you immediately attack with simultaneous kimura, juji gatame arm bar, ude gatame straight arm bar, wrist locks - all kinds of madness. Defense becomes far more difficult than usual because of the restrictions created by the triangle and the fact that you‚Äôre under threat of a strangle the whole time you‚Äôre struggling to defend yourself. Jiu jitsu has many such opportunities to turn two moves into one - make sure you look to incorporate them into your game! Here teenage blue belt phenom @helenajiujitsugirl Helena shows excellent form in combining the effects of triangle and arm bar together to get another win

"Victory in Dallas! The squad went 3-0 with every match won by submission here in Dallas tonight. South African purple belt phenom Luke Griffith wowed the audience with a spectacular submission via strangulation in the opening minutes of his match against a champion black belt. Keep your eyes on this guy! Brazilian super star Nicholas Meregali made his no gi debut and won with a beautifully applied arm bar in the closing seconds of the match. Gordon Ryan showed the kind of devastating pressure he is renown for to win via chest pressure submission against the very game emerging star Jacob Couch. It was fun taking the road trip from Austin to Dallas and having the event in the Dallas Cowboys home gym! Now it‚Äôs time to get back to Austin and get to work for the next performance! Hope you all enjoyed the show!!

"Helena Crevar - an outstanding talent: Recently a very talented female teenage athlete, @helenajiujitsugirl Helena Crevar, just fifteen years old, began training with us in Austin Texas. She has applied herself very well, rapidly making the shift to twice a day daily training and showing very admirable maturity and determination on the training mats. She has very supportive parents who come to every session and offer a very impressive level of support. Yesterday she had her first local competition against an adult 2x world champion and won in over time via takedown - despite only working takedowns upon her arrival here in Texas a relatively short time ago, showing her hard work and excellent learning ability combined with her excellent ability to apply knowledge under pressure on stage in match conditions against strong opponents. Well done Helena! Here she is in victory and then hanging out with fellow New Wave junior phenoms Luke Griffith @luke_griffithjj and Davis Asare @davis_asare after the win!
"
"Ideal vs reality: When it comes to practicing submission holds we usually practice them in the ideal finishing positions. That certainly makes the practice easier. However, the reality is that against a tough opponent who is trying to escape you will often have to finish in positions that are far from ideal - upside down, next to the perimeter, turning through three hundred sixty degrees, stacked up on head and shoulders. Your training should address this reality. You have to get a feeling for finishing in awkward, unanticipated situations or at least maneuvering from there to a more conventional finishing position. The ability to follow evasive defensive movement through all manner of twists and turns and get to your finish distinguishes the athlete who dabbles in submissions from one who truly specializes in them

"Go the extra distance when you pin: Great pinners in Jiu Jitsu always seek more than the basic position - they seek to additionally break their opponents posture and stance by getting opponents arms extended. If you can do this you greatly increase both the pressure of the pin and the chance it can be converted into submission. Next time you get into a solid pin, remind yourself to go further and get your opponents arms extended!!
"
"In an age of specialists: The game of Jiu jitsu has divided rather strongly into gi and no gi in the last decade, with most athletes making a choice to specialize in one or the other. Nicholas Meregali shocked the Jiu jitsu world just a couple of weeks ago by defeating the man most people considered the second best no gi grappler in the world, Kaynan Duarte in the most decisive way possible. Now he will compete just three weeks later in the @IBJJF IBJJF Grand Prix in Las Vegas in arguably the toughest gi competition of the year! Entered already are the great athletes, Victor Hugo, who will go in as favorite based on his outstanding performances earlier this year, Gabriel Rocha, Felipe Andrew, Gutemberg Peirera, Francisco Lonand others. This is a truly outstanding field. It will be a real challenge for Mr Meregali to try to win against the very best in both gi and no gi competition in such a short time frame. Ultimately we are all measured largely by the degree of difficulty of the challenges we take on - Mr Meregali has taken on one of the toughest challenges in grappling today - an all rounder in the age of specialists
"
"When you can‚Äôt train: Life has a way of throwing obstacles in our path. There will be many times when injury and circumstance will interrupt your ability to train. In most cases what this means is that you are temporarily unable to physically train your BODY - but this should not stop you from training your MIND. There are many things you can do that don‚Äôt involve the body. You can study great champions and learn from their example and potentially add some aspects of their game into yours. You can watch matches either on video or at your gym and follow the action mentally, placing yourself in the action on the side of one of the combatants and asking yourself second by second what you‚Äôd be doing differently out there and why. You can work some aspect of your physicality that, if it were to improve, your gym performance overall would also improve. So for example, if you had an injury  to the leg, you could work rope climbs to develop grip strength that will benefit you when you resume grappling. When Gordon Ryan suffered a terrible knee injury six months before 2019 ADCC most medical experts thought it was extremely unlikely he would be able to compete at all. For three months he came in every day to watch classes and we would quiz each other as we watched everyone train. When he finally got back on the mats his body was rusty but his jiu jitsu mind was sharper than ever. As soon as his body started moving properly his jiu jitsu looked better than before the injury due to the sharpness of his mental game. The mind governs and directs action. If the mind increases its powers during a lay off, the body will reveal Thais improvements as soon as it is able
"
"Jiu jitsu takedowns - controlling the aftermath of the takedown: A a very distinctive feature of the Jiu jitsu standing game that separates it from many other forms of grappling is THE THREE SECOND RULE which states that takedown points will not be awarded unless the athlete performing the takedown can demonstrate control after the takedown for three seconds where control is understood as the ability to hold an opponents hips, shoulder, side or one knee to the mat for the full three seconds. This is actually extremely difficult. In combat sports THREE SECONDS IS AN AWFULLY LONG TIME. The effect of this rule is that the takedown itself is not really what is valued in Jiu jitsu, rather, what is valued is the AFTERMATH of the takedown - THAT is what you get scored for. In practice your opponent will typically fight to keep his butt/side/shoulder/one knee off the mat. This means the points you score usually come from the scramble AFTER the takedown (rear mount is the most common). As Jiu jitsu students you must pay particular attention to controlling this crucial post takedown phase - very often this is the difference between a winning score versus a tiring scramble that ends with nothing.
"
"Your power is in your hips and legs: We humans are physically a rather feeble bunch compared with the other major mammals on this planet. One thing we do have going for us however, is the power of the hips. Your hips and legs are by far the strongest way to generate power and endurance that we have available - so it‚Äôs up to you to ensure that you make them the focus of your entire game. See you arms as just a means of connecting yourself to an opponent - but the engine room  of the body is downstairs in the hips and legs. Let this simple truth guide all your training, whether it be jiu jitsu or your strength and endurance training.
"
"Giving your best: We tend to think ‚Äúgiving your best effort‚Äù in Jiu jitsu means giving your best PHYSICAL effort. Indeed, we usually equate the degree to which we are physically spent at the end of the workout as the basis of the value of the workout. There certainly is virtue in regular hard physical work, but don‚Äôt think it ends there. As the old saying goes, the hardest work is hard thinking. After your physical work you must do your mental work. Study is work. Indeed it is work just as important as your physical work on the mats. You must engage in study of yourself, techniques and great athletes. Mental study reveals the lessons of todays physical work and sets the agenda for tomorrow‚Äôs physical work. Hard physical work without study is like a strong but blind man trying to work on a task, only study gives your physical work the vision required to get efficiently to your goals
"
"Jiu jitsu is a series of exchanges that begin with contact and end with separation - these are repeated over time until there is a result. This is important; it means that every time you re-engage, there is a chance for advantage if you engage on your terms. If you start most of the engagements on your terms, you will probably prevail over time. Every time you break contact and come back to re-engage, come back with a plan and act quickly on it as you approach. Don‚Äôt just lazily step towards the opponent and complacently come to grips. Have a sense how you will gain advantage from the moment of contact every time and you will steadily wear down even the toughest opponents

"
"The chase: When you begin to get threatening positions on good opponents they will often react by fleeing from the danger. This will create a chase sequence. When you go to chase a fleeing opponent you‚Äôve got two approaches. The first is to match or exceed your opponents speed of escape with speed of your pursuit. Here your success or failure is based on the development of your own speed. The second approach is to focus not on INCREASING YOUR speed, but rather on DECREASING YOUR OPPONENTS speed. Taking certain grips and positioning your bodyweight appropriately can immediately slow down even the most explosive and fast moving opponents. In general the preferred approach is to focus on slowing the other fellow down with positioning and grip rather than trying to outrace opponents, however, Id be liar if I said you‚Äôre always going to be able to slow opponents down, so it‚Äôs important to develop your acceleration up and off the mat to chase down fleeing opponents. In hard fought matches it‚Äôs usually the combination of both that lets you reel in and recapture an opponent in flight.

"Watching the mighty Thais in training: I landed at midnight in Singapore last night - today it was workout time with Garry Tonon who will be matched against the brilliant submission specialist Tye Ruotolo this Friday night in a ten minute grappling bout as part of the @onechampionship mixed MMA/Grappling event! Mr Ruotolo and his twin brother Kade have been in incredible form this last year - both racking up impressive victories over the best in the sport with their lightning fast entries into submissions, exhausting pace and excellent integration of ground and standing technique - this will be without question one of Mr Tonon‚Äôs toughest matches. When in Singapore I love to train at @evolvemma in Far East Square. It‚Äôs always an incredible experience to walk in and see some of the very best Muay Thai athletes doing their daily workouts. The level of Muay Thai here is incredible. They have a level of finesse and efficiency in every aspect of their movement that is truly a sight to behold and a true inspiration to all of the other combat sports. Today I had the privilege of watching the great Nong-O go through his workout. His workout sets a standard of excellence that every martial artist should strive for regardless of their discipline. When it comes to watching sports outside my own I really don‚Äôt care WHAT i watch - SO LONG AS ITS THE BEST IN THE WORLD DOING IT - because the best always have a way of doing things that illuminate and inspire  you in whatever you do yourself. It‚Äôs fascinating to watch the way the elite Thais move between extreme focus and precision one moment and yet shift into relaxed joviality the next, then right back to work. Thank you to @evolvemma gym for the being such a great place to get ready for the toughest challenges
"
"Play the long game: We always tend to walk into the trap of thinking we are defined by our achievements of today - we aren‚Äôt - ultimately you‚Äôll be judged by your achievements over the course of your career. Once you understand this you can begin to see that your central concern must always be improvement over time. Any failure today can be over turned by great success down the line. Your jiu jitsu may well be lousy now, but that implies nothing about how it will be in five years. Focus on building to the future and be confident that any deficiencies here and now can be reversed with training and adaptation in the future. No one was born good at Jiu jitsu, neither were the best at Jiu jitsu ALWAYS good at Jiu jitsu - they had their time as clumsy beginners just like you. Play the long game. Focus on gaining knowledge and developing skill and one day that will turn you into a very different person on the mat!

"Undermining athleticism: It‚Äôs a great thing to possess good athletic traits. They will definitely help you make progress in any sport including jiu jitsu. Much more important in jiu jitsu however, is the ability to UNDERMINE AN OPPONENTS ATHLETICISM. If you can shackle an opponents movement it won‚Äôt be long before victory is yours. One of the very best methods is to control both legs. Just as cowboys begin control of a powerful steer by roping its legs, so too, a good grappler seeks to tie up both an opponents legs when it‚Äôs time to control him. When you‚Äôre confronted by an athletic speedster, look for every opportunity to tie up both his legs and you‚Äôll find his speed and balance are severely impacted in ways that permit control that leads to submission

"First contact: Grappling sports are all about making contact and keeping contact in order to control opponents. Nonetheless there are many times when the two athletes will break contact and then have to re-establish contact and begin anew. These times of ESTABLISHING CONTACT that occur multiple times per match are times of great opportunity and great danger. It is very important you have a plan as to want your want PRIOR to making contact, so that you act with a sense of direction. You need two things: first, defensive soundness. You can establish contact in a way that makes you vulnerable to a quick attack that leaves you struggling to catch up. Second, an offensive plan that lets you gain the initiative from the onset of the action. So work from behind a sound stance and positioning that doesn‚Äôt leave you exposed to easy attacks and have an idea of what you want to do as soon as contact is made - if you can do these two things the rest of the action that ensues is much more likely to go in your favor
"
"Submissions never begin in a completed state: When you think of a perfect submission hold you think of the final state of the move, where everything is set in place and locked out. This is not how they begin however. Submissions typically start with an entrance that is quite far from the completed form. You have to work from that initial start to the final position. That process of going from initial entrance to final locked out submission will have to be done against maximal resistance. In order to be successful you‚Äôll need to be able to work step by step, being sure to make each step reinforced so that resistance doesn‚Äôt destroy your progress. If the resistance proves too strong, you‚Äôll need alternative finishes that can be realistically made from the starting submission. Here I have locked in the starting position for a front triangle. There is still a lot of work to be done from here to get the original submission. My choices will be to either work step by step to complete the front triangle; if I take this option I‚Äôll need to be able to lock each step so as to maintain my progress. So for example I could use my left land to grip my right shin to prevent slippage as I turn an angle to shift into the completed triangle.  Failing this I could shift off to a new choice of submission, juji gatame arm bar variations, omo plata, ude gatame straight arm bar, kimura and te gatame arm lock are obvious candidates here. Make sure you map your options from the entry to finish of your favorite submissions ahead of time, there won‚Äôt always be time in a competitive match to figure it out on the fly, so have your favorites sorted out in training so they‚Äôre ready when you need them!
"
"Survive first - escape second: When you first begin Jiu jitsu is natural to feel totally intimidated by the power of your more experienced training partners attacks. Some days you feel that as soon as they get a good position on you, it‚Äôs all over. Start with the most modest, yet important Jiu jitsu goal - survival. Begin by seeing how long you can hold off submission attacks. Learn to tuck your him back in close to your torso and chin to chest. Learn to turn on your side rather than flat on your back so that you can bear weight more comfortably. Once survival seems attainable you can learn to relax a little - AS ANXIETY LEVELS FALL, YOUR CAPACITY TO THINK, REASON, RECALL INFORMATION AND SOLVE PROBLEMS WILL INCREASE - and that‚Äôs what will get you out of bad positions. Everything begins with survival skill that leads to mental calm. Mental calm begets sound decision making and sound decisions will create the routes you need to exit out of trouble. Make your first goals small. How much longer can you hold off a partner who usually finishes you in one minute from dominate position? If you can last two minutes you‚Äôre getting twice as good as before - that‚Äôs a small beginning, but most beginnings are small - in time they can lead to results that are huge.
"
"Quick movements get you TO a good position, but it will be isometric endurance/tension and locking yourself into the geometry of your opponents body that will KEEP you there. The value of getting to a good position is lost if you can‚Äôt maintain it. The skills of maintaining a position are never going to make a highlight reel but they are among the most important for winning matches. Your ability to gain a good position is only as useful as your ability to keep it long enough to exert pressure and progress into even better positions or submission holds. Focus upon shutting down your opponent‚Äôs ability to move in the ways that might enable him to escape. Every escape begins with a first step - so attack that first step with your body positioning and tension and if you do your job well, you won‚Äôt have to worry about the subsequent steps.

"Victory in Florida! Giancarlo Bodoni had an outstanding performance last night in Fort Meyers, Florida last night in @bluecollarfc professional grappling event. The grappling invitational featured a truly outstanding field of all ADCC athletes so it really was the best athletes scrapping it out for a $25,000 prize. The field of athletes was incredible - there wasn‚Äôt a single easy match in the eight man bracket. Roberto Jimenez, Vagner Rocha, Elder Cruz, Roosevelt Sousa, Jay - Rod, Andy Varela are all ADCC trials winners and world championships veterans - at the end of the night it was Giancarlo who battled his way to the win! Another amazing performance from this outstanding athlete!! Now he travels to England for an absolute tournament featuring the best European, American and Brazilian grapplers - Giancarlo showing that he is one of the hardest working athletes in the game as well as one of the most successful!
"
"Angle is your friend: Gunning for submissions underneath a tough opponent is never easy work - but you can generally make it easier if you consistently look for side on angles that result in your hips coming out to one side rather than being square on and exposed to all of your opponents weight in vulnerable stacking positions. Arm bars, triangles, omoplatas all benefit from getting your hips out. Often a big help is to scoop your arm deep inside your opponents leg and use it to help pull yourself to a good angle. Whatever method you opt for, look to get hips out/side on, and soon you will suffering a lot fewer failures to to stacking counters to your favorite submissions from bottom position
"
"How good are you at getting out of bad positions? Whenever people ask me to diagnose their skill level one of the first things I observe is their skill at getting out of bad positions. Why? Because that will tell me not only how good they are DEFENSIVELY but also OFFENSIVELY. This might strike you as strange. How can defensive skill reflect your offensive skill? Simple - the more faith you have in your defense the more risks you will take with your offense. Your success will always be determined by the amount of risk you are willing to subject yourself to. As they say - NOTHING RISKED, NOTHING GAINED. If you won‚Äôt take the risk associated with offense you‚Äôll never even begin an attack. If you‚Äôre afraid that when you try to attack you may be open to positional counters that leave you pinned in holds from which you can‚Äôt escape - then you won‚Äôt take the risk of attacking. The only thing that will liberate you from those fears that hold you back is the belief that you can escape any hold. The moment you believe that you will attack and hold nothing back.
"
"The quality of your offense in jiu jitsu  is proportional to the quality of your connection to your opponent. If you can latch on with tightness you can be very effective, but looseness of connection will create failure before you even begin the technique. Cultivate connection and your jiu jitsu offense will have a great foundation
"
"Perceptions: How your opponent perceives you has a HUGE impact upon their behavior towards you in a match. If they do not perceive you as dangerous towards them, they will engage with total confidence and use their full arsenal of weapons without any concern for you. If, on the other hand, they believe you are a substantial threat to them, they will engage with trepidation and hold back from using many of their moves for fear of bad consequences if they don‚Äôt work. It is MUCH easier to engage an opponent who is more worried about what you can do to them, than what they will do to you. The single best way to create this perception of danger in your opponents is to build a strong submissions game. Nothing induces fear and respect in grappling as well as the ability to finish an opponent. Develop your submissions as a strong point and opponents will immediately take you seriously and show a marked reluctance to over commit to their favorite moves and shy away from even using many other moves that they would normally employ.
"
"Some moves come easily - others, not so much: I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve had the experience of going to learn a given moves that you‚Äôve come to believe is important for your development; but then really struggling to get it to work. Even in drilling it feels clumsy and unnatural compared with other moves you seemingly learned much more easily. Our ability to learn new skills in Jiu jitsu isn‚Äôt evenly spread - some seem natural the first time you try them and others feel like a disaster waiting to happen. Don‚Äôt get discouraged by this. Remember - you aren‚Äôt judged by how good you are at a given move in a given time frame, but rather, by the excellence of the finished product when you‚Äôre at your peak with that move - sometimes that‚Äôll be sooner, sometimes later. I‚Äôve seen athletes look completely hopeless at a move when first trying it out but then two years later they were winning championships with it. Don‚Äôt be discouraged by a slower rate of learning with some moves - the construction phase doesn‚Äôt define you - only the finished product that that
"
"Pinning - get stable first, create pressure second, and work for submissions third: The essential goal in  classical Jiu jitsu is to get opponents into the two types of mounted positions - front and rear - and from there, finish them. This is a time tested and true tactic that works well at all levels and should be heavily emphasized in your early training. When working in the mounted position on top of opponents, take your development in stages. Your first goal is just to gain STABILITY. Even that can be tough when you begin since opponents will be bucking and bridging and twisting to get out from under you. Once you feel you hold people for extended periods of time, the next challenge is to put them under PRESSURE and duress. This is usually done by pressure on the jaw via cross face grips and keeping your chest on their face to hamper breathing. Understand that the more duress you can put opponents under, the easier submissions will become as they react to the uncomfortable pressure of your pin. Only then do we work on the final goal of submitting people. Start with STABILITY and PRESSURE - the better you are in these two skills, the easier the final goal of submission will be.

"Easy like a Sunday morning: Not every workout has to be a war. I demand of my students that they aspire to train every day - but I certainly don‚Äôt demand that they train HARD every day. Learn to pace your workouts over the course of a week. The more days a week you train and the more times a day, the more you need to switch pace among workouts. If you‚Äôre training multiple times a day seven days a week it becomes absolutely essential that you have different speeds and intensities for different workouts or you will burn out quite quickly and increase your risk of injuries. If you train recreationally a few times a week pacing becomes less important, until you start getting older - then it becomes an important element of your training as older athletes typically don‚Äôt recover as quickly between workouts as younger athletes. Develop a sense of listening to your body, but balance this with a solid discipline that doesn‚Äôt allow you to lapse into laziness and make unjustified excuses to take it easy when you should be working harder. Finding that balance takes time but it‚Äôs crucial to your longevity in the sport.

"First workout in Puerto Rico: It was great to be back on the mats in a new land here today. We drove into San Juan with friends to work out with Nicky Ryan, Ethan Crelinsten, Oliver Taza and teenage standout Big Dan Manasoiu to work out with our Puerto Rican friends and get things started. It‚Äôs great to get acclimated and active early and show people our Jiu jitsu philosophy and technique. Soon the rest of the squad will arrive and we will get to work opening a training facility and getting everyone to their Jiu Jitsu potential. Adelante y hacia arriba!!
"
"Beginners in Jiu jitsu ignore their opponents grips and entanglements because they don‚Äôt understand the dangers they lead to. As they learn and develop expertise they come to see the danger and start to break grips as soon as they become a threat. But the very best athletes go back to the start and ignore grips - this time not from ignorance, but from the knowledge that if you reach a high enough level you can let an opponent take any grip he likes and use it as the opening to your own attacks. The opponents grip becomes a shortcut to your own offense.
"
"If he can‚Äôt grip you, then he can‚Äôt control you: It‚Äôs often a good idea to focus on controlling your opponents hands and arms whenever you feel they are controlling you with grip. Some opponents just feel like once they put hands on you they can dominate. Don‚Äôt give them the luxury of putting grips on you. Control their hands or get your hands and elbows inside their arms and you will severely limit their ability to use their superior strength through grips upon your body. You don‚Äôt want to play this game exclusively as it can degenerate into a negative game where you focus too much on interfering with what the other fellow is doing rather than focusing primarily on what you want to do, but used for short periods of time and/or specific opponents it can be a big help when fighting bigger and stronger opponents
"
"Why is guard position the most emphasized position in Jiu Jitsu? When you look at all the various grappling arts you will see that the most distinctive facet of Jiu Jitsu is it‚Äôs heavy emphasis upon guard position. Many grappling arts such as wrestling do not have it all. Others such as Judo and Sambo have it but it is not heavily emphasized or seen as desirable. So why does Jiu jitsu make it the centerpiece of its game? There are several good answers you could offer. You might argue along the longs of tactical or historical considerations and certainly there are some very interesting possibilities there. I have always favored a more physical argument. Jiu jitsu has an ideal - the ability to control greater size and strength with lesser size and strength. Other grappling styles have the same ideal, but a different way of realizing it. Judo has this ideal and due to it being a predominantly standing art using balance breaking as its primary means of overcoming greater size and strength. Jiu jitsu does it primarily by MATCHING THE STRENGTH OF THE LOWER BODY AGAINST AN OPPONENTS UPPER BODY WHERE EVER POSSIBLE. An opponent may be considerably larger than you, but his arms will not be stronger than your legs. Guard position allows you to match your leg and hip strength against an opponent arms and shoulders - a battle that a smaller, weaker person with skills can realistically win against a bigger stronger person. Among us human beings the difference between the strength and endurance of our lower body compared with our upper body is considerable - match your legs against a bigger opponents arms and you‚Äôre matching your stronger half against his weaker half - that‚Äôs how smaller people can beat bigger people on the floor - and that‚Äôs why I have faith in guard position as the basis of the bottom game.
"
"The more off center you get - the better it gets: In most cases in jiu jitsu nothing good happens  when you‚Äôre directly in front of opponents. The idea is almost always to get angle that enables you to get the advantage of flank. Going in through the front door is hard and risky work - it‚Äôs much better to slip in the side door whenever possible. Make a conscious effort in every engagement to work to an angle prior to launching the main attack and you‚Äôll suddenly find that moves that never worked for you suddenly start working and opponents you could never score on, suddenly you‚Äôre putting them under pressure. In combat sports, angle is everything and the more the better. Make it a habit you‚Äôll soon make a habit of winning
"
"When grappling strong opponents sometimes it feels like their arms are like iron bars - but I promise you - if you can can put an opponents hand behind their back, even the strongest arm will feel weak. Exploit this physiological fact whenever you can!
"
"Victory in Texas!! The squad went on a leg lock rampage tonight here in Austin Texas in a grappling super show with Whose Number One/Flograppling. The show featured many of the finest and most highly ranked grapplers in a night of super fight showdowns. Nicky Ryan took on one of the best wrestlers in the nation, Tony Ramos. Mr Ryan was able to quickly latch on to a very tight outside ashi garami and employ a very powerful heel hook for an impressive win. Craig Jones played his usual super smooth guard game and latched into a superb inside Sankaku early in his match with the outstanding Roberto Jimenez. Controlling both legs in a very example of double trouble control he exposed his opponents heel and secured one of his frighteningly powerful finishes. Then Gordon Ryan stepped on stage for the main event against current ADCC World Champion one weight division below him, the powerful and explosive Matheus Diniz, a master of tactical Jiu jitsu. Mr Ryan took a rather leisurely pace as it was a thirty minutes match. He scored two impressive reversals from guard position to get mounted and put his opponent under great physical pressure, until he used an off balancing movement from underneath to enter into a very tight inside sankaku with double trouble control and then apply a very well controlled heel hook finish. Three matches against stud opponents and three leg lock submissions - that‚Äôs a a great night in Texas!! Hope you all enjoyed the show!! Looking forward to another big show here in December üòúüòú
"
"Hands and head: When you first make contact with an opponent whether it be standing or from seated guard situations, the first points of contact with your opponent will typically be at the hands and forehead. Learning to place them so as to create defensive barriers and then manipulate them to create offensive opportunities is a big part of your opening gambits in Jiu jitsu. Understand always that your head and hands have both defensive and offensive value - but that in most cases it‚Äôs tactically smart to take care of your defensive responsibilities before your offensive ones. Your head and hands are both a barrier and a key to your opponents door that can give you access to everything else. Use them wisely from the start of each engagement and you will stop an opponent in his tracks whilst setting up your own attacks
"
"Nicholas Meregali and the power of routine: The great Brazilian champion Nicholas Meregali has been training with us this week. In one of our first conversations he said something important that be be of great value to you. Having just arrived in Austin I asked him how things were going and whether he was well situated for training. He replied that everything was fine, he had an AirBnB and car and that now all he needed was to find a supermarket and ESTABLISH A DAILY TRAINING ROUTINE. That was his first concern - to establish a ROUTINE. This is the great characteristic I see in all champions. Human greatness is based on developing SKILLS and skills can only be developed by following a training regimen over time - that is, to establish and follow a ROUTINE. A life of routine is often disparaged as a poor way to live life. I agree that a life of routine is terrible if you are stuck in a routine that is totally divorced from your life passions. If you have a routine job that you hate, surrounded by people you can‚Äôt stand, in a location you despise - then yes - a life of routine would be awful. However, if you have a deep passion in your life, then devoting yourself to a routine aligned with that passion, a routine that every day brings you a little closer to a cherished goal, then this is one of the best life directions you can ever have. So find that passion and build a routine around it - let the power of daily routine build skills over time, skills that one day, when fate puts opportunity in front of you, will let you shine
"
"Create a strong initial threat and you will own the next move: If you can put your opponent under extreme pressure with a given move it will elicit such a focus on defense that you will have a considerable tactical advantage in any follow up move. An opponent whose entire attention is bound up defending one move will be very vulnerable to any subsequent move. It is up to you however, to develop the sensitivity to know how to keep the pressure on the first attempt but know inside that it‚Äôs unlikely to break through the opponents defense and concoct a good follow up. There are two ways you can fail with this. The first is Tunnel vision that keeps you focused only on that first move when it‚Äôs becoming clear that it won‚Äôt work. The second is not putting enough pressure on the first move so the opponent is not sufficiently distracted and can thus defend the second move as soon as you attempt it. Learning to balance these two demands is a big part of your development towards a strong offense
"
"As long as you‚Äôve got a foot and leg between you and your opponent you‚Äôve got a line of defense and counter offense: Sometimes you feel your opponent has gotten a move on you and you‚Äôll have to concede a score. Be confident that as long as you‚Äôve got a leg between you then you can use it to elevate and opponent, create and maintain space, establish some degree of control through connection and use this to first stop an opponent and even counter them. Sometimes what seems like a tenuous line of defense can turn out to be surprisingly effective!
"
"Master the Open Guard with the great @danaherjohn in todays Daily Deal! üóú
"
"It all begins with push and pull: Open guard is perhaps the most most quintessential modern Jiu jitsu position. It probably offers a wider array of potential attacks than any other position in the sport - but they all begin the same way - get a grip and engage in push and pull to break an opponents stance/balance and create a reaction. If you can reliably initiate the push/pull sequence at the onset of most engagements you will have the foundation of a great open guard. Next time you practice open guard focus first on the preliminary push and pull and your will find that as you improve in this regard, all the other moves you wanted to perform come easier
"
"Anticipating failure: It‚Äôs good to be confident with your favorite moves and believe that you can get them to work anytime any place on any athlete - but we‚Äôve got to be realistic too - sometimes your favorite move isn‚Äôt going to work, so we got to have effective back ups that enable us to go past an initial failure into success. Certain moves go hand in hand with each other. If you‚Äôve got a favorite it‚Äôs important you back it up with appropriate follow ups when that inevitable failure arises. That way you‚Äôll go immediately into a second move (and potentially third or fourth when you‚Äôre really getting good (any further than four is an indication that your mechanics are poor and it‚Äôs more likely you need to improve your execution than that your opponent has great defense)). So yes - it‚Äôs important you anticipate failure. This isn‚Äôt being negative, it‚Äôs being realistic. Just make sure you‚Äôve got good follow ups that failure will open a door to success
"
"In a crises situation, everything begins with a calm mind: There is a huge amount physical stress associated with bad/inferior positions in Jiu Jitsu. If your opponent knows what s/he is doing, they can make your life thoroughly miserable with cross faces, chest to chest pressure, forcing you into contorted positions etc. it‚Äôs very natural for that PHYSICAL pressure to create MENTAL pressure, where you feel stress to a point where you start to lose effective decision making capability. This creates a vicious spiral where additional mental stress shuts down your ability to plan escapes, resulting in worsening physical stress, which creates still more mental stress, which begets additional physical stress...Learning to maintain a calm mind under intense physical pressure will enable you to see what needs to be done and make decisions to get you out of there. The only real way to develop serenity of mind under pressure is to experience that pressure often enough to adapt to it. Here, Gordon Ryan works on his mental game as much as his physical game by absorbing the powerful cross face pressure of Georges St -Pierre, who has passed many Jiu Jitsu champions half guards from this position. ONLY THE CALM MIND CAN MAKE SOUND CALCULATIONS, and that ability to observe accurately what‚Äôs happening and calculate what‚Äôs needed to turn things in your favor is what will make the difference in your sport performance when things are not going your way.

"Victory in Florida! Outstanding New Wave athlete Helena Crevar @helenajiujitsugirl won double gold today at the IBJJF Pan Ams in juvenile blue belt division - both weight division and absolute. Here she is with her proud parents who do so much to support her training and competition preparation. The teenage phenom won every match by submission with not a single point being scored on her in a blistering display of positional pressure and submission skill. In addition, BJJ icon Nicholas Meregali advanced to tomorrow‚Äôs open weight finals with a devastating display of his submission skills - winning every match by strangle or suffocation from mount or rear mount. Tomorrow he will contest his weight division and the absolute final! It‚Äôs been great watching the matches today - so many talented athletes in all weight divisions, belt levels and age brackets! Keep your eyes on events tomorrow!!
"
"Happy New Year! 2022 turned out to be quite a year! I hope the next year turns into a great one for you and that you are able to work closer towards your goals in Jiu jitsu! Keep working hard, constantly monitor your progress so that you can continue and improve in the areas that are creating progress and remove the elements that aren‚Äôt. Understand always that patience is a true virtue and that no matter how hard you try, you need time to manifest improvement. Have faith that consistent improvement and time create a union that will take you further than anyone thought possible. Wishing you all the best from Austin Texas!!
"
"Merging defense and offense: When an opponent attacks with a given move your first responsibility is to stop that move - put your shields up and blunt the attack - but the second you‚Äôve done so - don‚Äôt congratulate yourself on your defensive success - get immediately to work on counter offense. One of the most profitable times to attack an opponent is in the immediate aftermath of a failed attack. Why? Because in most cases his posture and stance will be broken and posture and stance are the basis of defense. Take advantage of that window of opportunity and get to work. Strong defense is a wonderful thing, but even better is strong defense as a prelude to offense
"
"Fighting until the last: In Jiu Jitsu it‚Äôs natural to get a sense that a battle has been lost and stop fighting. Sometimes it‚Äôs tactically smart to think this way - for example, you can recognize that one battle has been lost so stop fighting that battle so that you can reserve your forces for the next one. Other times however, you‚Äôll want to fight to the end and concede nothing. This is often the case with guard retention. Understand that until your opponent has completely cleared your legs and pinned your head and one shoulder down for three seconds - he has not passed your guard. That gives you a LOT of leeway for last minute, last second scramble defense that can prevent a score and keep you in the game. Here, Garry Tonon fights to keep his shoulders off the mat to prevent a score even though his opponent has cleared his legs. This is the kind of spirit you usually want to exhibit in guard retention battles!
"
"Strangles: There is no question that the most high percentage submission attack in Jiu jitsu is variations of rear strangles. You could make a great career in the sport with no other submission but that. However, it is great importance that you compliment your rear strangles with at least one really good strangle from the front. It doesn‚Äôt matter too much which you you choose - Guillotine variations, Darce, anaconda, seated kata gatame or another - they all work well. The dual threat from both directions greatly amplifies the effectiveness of the techniques since as an opponent defends from one he inevitably exposes himself to the other. Make sure you have strong strangles from both front and back, at least one of each that you have total confidence in - you‚Äôll soon become a real force on the mat!
"
"One move - many applications: I would rather a student was familiar with ten variations of one move than ten different moves. Why? Because variants of a move are usually very similar to each other. As a result proficiency in one leads to rapid progress with the others. In addition, each variant provides a solution to an opponents resistance to the previous variant, so that you will have the ability to apply the move against skilled resistance - the single most important element in the successful application of moves in sparring and competition. This will garner far better results than superficial knowledge of many different moves. Get a small number of moves that you can excel in - develop many variations of each to cover the many variables you‚Äôll have to cope with in sparring and you‚Äôll be on a winning path!

"Victory in Las Vegas! New Wave Jiu jitsu sent a team of talented juniors to the @ufcfightpass event UFC Fight Pass Invitational where they competed in four vs four team events under the leadership of Anthony Pettis. @olivertaza @jiujitsugiant @giancarlobodoni @cpapadelos performed very well under the lights Big Dan got two submissions in the first round, Giancarlo Bodoni had a dominant showing against the very talented 10th planet athlete PJ Barch and Oliver Taza secured victory in the final round with a fine submission over the very talented ADCC trials winner Jay Rodriguez from B Team and then showed a strong positional game against the great Penn State wrestler Bo Nickal with a reversal and several guard passes to win a close decision victory for his team. Great stuff from the youngsters in Vegas!!
"
"A New Years challenge: Are you unhappy with your recent Jiu jitsu progress? If so, here is a fun challenge for you. Name a champion Jiu jitsu athlete who has a body type and personality that seems in line with your own. Watch a highlight reel of him or her in action. Select one of his signature moves that you believe is something that would apply well to your own game, but which you do not currently use, or don‚Äôt perform well. Watch his set ups, mechanics, tactics, follow ups. Note what he does well and try to assess what he doesn‚Äôt do well with it and what could be improved (I know that might seem difficult at first but try even just as a learning exercise). Now start to think of ways you could integrate that move into your game and how you would both incorporate and modify your champions methods. Once you have a good mental picture of the move, start working on it physically with a friend. Try to teaching back to your friend what you figured out in your own study. When it starts to feel quite natural in drilling - try to hit it in sparring. Afterwards think about your successes and failures with it. Work on this for one month and see how far you can take it. IF YOU COULD DO THIS EVERY MONTH FOR A YEAR YOU WOULD HAVE A SUBSTANTIALLY DIFFERENT GAME IN TWELVE MONTHS. This is more than a great learning experience, it‚Äôs a fine way to kick start your game out of a lull and add something good in a practical way - give it a try! You have nothing to lose and everything to gain!
"
"Well, that‚Äôs one way to spend Thanksgiving!! Hope you guys are all having a wonderful day with friends and family wherever you are! Thank you all so much for the interest you have in the work and development of my students and the never ending quest to improve our beloved sport! ü§óüá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏ü§ó Happy Thanksgiving from Austin Texas!
"
"Take your time when your opponent is carrying your weight: Speed is a wonderful thing and nothing makes the highlight feels more than a speedy entry and completion of a move. However, there is a lot to be said for taking your time whenever your opponent is carrying your weight. This will quickly exhaust even the strongest and fittest opponents of done well. Remember - once they get tired they‚Äôll slow down, so you won‚Äôt need much speed to stay ahead and look faster than normal. Next time you can feel your opponent straining under your weight - slow things down - you will almost always be pleased with the results
"
"The value of position: In the context of GRAPPLING, the value of position is fourfold. First, it enables you to attack the upper body with submission holds. If you couldn‚Äôt pass guard, you would be limited to lower body submissions, so it enables you to access one hundred percent of the human body. Second, it creates an imbalance between your ability to attack with submission versus your opponents ability. From neutral positions you can both attack each other with equal efficacy, but from dominant position you will be able to attack via submission far more readily than your opponent can. Third, position allows you to attack and re-attack at will until the breakthrough is achieved. If a first attack fails, you still have the position to launch a second, third or fourth attack until you get it done. Fourth, position creates pressure over time that breaks an opponent with fatigue and loss of hope, in extreme cases even outright panic. Once broken mentally, the physical breakthrough comes soon after. Now these are all valuable, the but in FIGHTING, position has a whole new value - striking. You can strike with great power and effect from neutral positions if you have the right skills, but striking from dominant positions is truly devastating. As such, you can never neglect your positional skill development if you think of your Jiu jitsu as part of a program to develop fighting skill. The damage you can inflict with strikes from dominant position can be meted out far faster and easier than any submission technique and the the terrible pressure it can create to an opponent will usually make subsequent submissions much easier.
"
"Your toughest matches will always reveal where your game is weakest. Use them as a laboratory to know yourself better. Knowing yourself and your strengths and weaknesses is one of the cornerstones of continued progress.
"
"Remember - in Jiu jitsu it‚Äôs not how much you‚Äôve learned that counts - it‚Äôs HOW MUCH CAN YOU RECALL AND PERFORM UNDER STRESS that counts. As such don‚Äôt put your emphasis on AMOUNT of information but rather upon SUMMARY of information. Better to know the two most pertinent details for a given scenario than twenty of lesser importance. Constantly look for ways to filter all the information you receive into summaries that work for you as an individual to recall under pressure. As a teacher I can give a mountain of details but you must actively seek to focus on the ones that are most important for improving your individual performance.

"Legends: Its great to be around the excitement of ADCC this weekend! I am thrilled to see that two of the most important people in jiu jitsu career are going to be rewarded with induction into the ADCC Hall of Fame - my teacher Renzo Gracie  and my great friend and mentor Roger Gracie. Both were great champions and both are great coaches who were pivotal figures in the growth of our sport and also in my own development. I am eternally grateful for their guidance. It‚Äôs also great to my friend from that same era, Kyra Gracie, one of the most polished athletes I ever saw get her induction to the hall of fame alongside her family members! It was great seeing all three today here in Las Vegas!

"When you have one - you have the other: There are certain submissions where if you have that submission, you always have easy access to another submission. So for example, if you have an inside heel hook, you almost always have easy access to an outside heel hook (among other options). One of the most important examples of this is the relationship between ARM BAR (juji gatame) and TRIANGLE (sankaku). It is almost always the case that if you have one, you can easily switch to the other. It‚Äôs important that you are always cognizant of this because there will be many times that a simple and prompt switch from one to the other will be necessary to finish a strongly resisting opponent. Interestingly these two options often have a symbiotic relationship - the more an opponent resists one, the easier it becomes to apply the other, so that the threat of one aids the application of the other. We all have a tendency to get locked into tunnel vision when focusing hard on a move - knowing ahead of time that certain moves are closely linked to others and that you always have that second option is a good way to restore the vision you need to see the full range of opportunities in front of you

"You are the average of your best offensive moves and your worst defensive moves: Your ability on the mat overall has two crucial parameters. The ability of your best offensive moves to break through and score/finish; and your worst defensive moves that enable and opponent to score/finish you. You aren‚Äôt measure purely by your best offense and you aren‚Äôt measured by your worst defense but rather the average of the two. You therefore have a responsibility to bring both as high as possible to increase your effectiveness overall. If you have good offense but gaping holes in your defense your average will be lower than it ought to be; similarly when your defense is rock solid but your offense is weak. Bring your average up by working on both areas and never neglecting one for the other.

"Push and pull: If you wish to excel in Jiu jitsu there is one seemingly simple edict upon which much of your future success or failure depends - when an opponent pulls - push - and when he pushes - pull. It‚Äôs a simple and well known idea that people TALK about all the time and then forget as soon as they start sparring. Don‚Äôt just SAY it - LIVE AND BREATH IT every time you‚Äôre on the mat and I promise you that your performance will increase overnight. When you have a strongly resisting opponent this fundamental maxim will help your performance more than anyone technique will. Learn to take advantage of the power of your opponents force and you will make a strong man fight HIS OWN STRENGTH as well as yours!
"
"Start well end well: When it comes to getting grip and/connection to an opponent - YOU MUST FACTOR IN EXPECTED RESISTANCE TO THAT GRIP/CONNECTION. Every time you make a grip with your arms or legs you can expect resistance from a knowledgeable opponent. This resistance will loosen and weaken whatever grip or connection you‚Äôve made. If you start with ADEQUATE grip/connection, that will resistance will immediately make it INADEQUATE - which will result in failure. If you start with PLENITUDINOUS grip/connection the expected resistance will lower to to ADEQUATE level - which is enough to get the job done. Keep this in mind when fighting for grip and connection and success will come to you more often when coming to grips with tough opponents
"
"The back is truly one of the key grappling positions, but like any good position, it can be made even better by going the extra distance and Trapping your opponents defensive arms - making a good position great. When it comes to pins, don‚Äôt settle for just the position itself - get the position AND trap the opponents arms and you‚Äôll convert the pin to a submission much more often!!
"
"Forethought: Things happen quickly once sparring begins. It‚Äôs a lot easier to get things done against a tough opponent if you have at least a rough idea of what you want to do before you attempt the next move. AS YOU ARE ATTEMPTING ONE MOVE, YOU SHOULD ALREADY HAVE AN IDEA OF WHAT YOUR NEXT MOVE SHOULD BE IF THE FIRST MOVE SUCCEEDS. Here, Gordon Ryan has stood up and successfully opened his training partners guard. This gives good attacking opportunities to BOTH athletes. THE INITIATIVE WILL GO TO THE ONE WHO MOVES WISELY FIRST. The only way to consistently do this is to look beyond the move you are currently performing and plot the next so that the very second the previous move is completed, you are entering the next. You must train your mind to operate this way. It‚Äôs unrealistic to plot too far out into the future - there are too many variables to control more than a move or two into the future. One step ahead is enough to gain advantage. Don‚Äôt be satisfied with the move your doing now - let your mind be restlessly seeking out the next move - and you will soon find yourself seizing the initiative from your opponents in sparring and competition
"
"Raising the revs: Any time you enter into a scramble with an opponent and neither of you has definitive control over the other and one has the threat of gaining advantageous position - you‚Äôre going to have to raise your energy expenditure to cope with the situation regardless of whether your the attacker or the defender. As the attacker it‚Äôs worth the extra energy expense because of the chance of a score. As the defender it‚Äôs worth the energy expenditure because you don‚Äôt want to concede a score. The question becomes - at what point do you stop the scramble because it‚Äôs costing you too much energy and the probability of a favorable outcome has diminished to a point where it makes more sense to stop scrambling? Its never easy to answer these questions. There are too many variables so each has to be answered on a case by case basis, but one thing can be said in every case - the athlete who can PROLONG A SCRAMBLE while keeping energy expenditure within acceptable limits has a huge advantage in a competitive match. Anyone can pace themselves in a controlled situation, but only the best can do so in a chaotic situation

"Even the best move applied at the best time can fail due to just a single mistake if the opponent is strong on defense. Aim for perfection in every aspect of execution - you can‚Äôt close every door - but the more you do - the more success you will have. Don‚Äôt be satisfied with good, aim for great in your areas of specialty in the game!
"
"Never lose track of the basic fact that one well applied submission will win a match but a dozen submissions applied with anything less than full technical and tactical proficiency won‚Äôt score even a single point - forget about win a match. Let the lesson be clear - quality beats quantity in the submissions game.
"
"Read your opponent: Competitive matches are a lot easier to win if you know what your opponent is going to do before he does it. Unfortunately our opponents don‚Äôt tell us what they intend to do prior to doing it. Sometimes they even deceive us by creating an appearance of wanting to do one thing and then actually doing another. However, the body does not lie nearly as much as the mouth - you must learn to READ what an opponent really intends to do through observing his STANCE, MOTION and LEVEL among other things. If your opponent holds his body in a certain way, it will enable some kinds of action and prohibit others. This will immediately give you clues as to what he intends to do. If you feint offensive movements you will get a chance to read his responses and get good insight into his counter game. USE THE INTIAL ENCOUNTER AT THE START OF THE MATCH AND EVERY SUBSEQUENT TIME YOU RE-ENGAGE WITH YOUR OPPONENT TO HET INSIGHTS INTO WHAT HE INTENDS TO DO. You‚Äôve spent your entire life learning to read people‚Äôs eyes and body to make assessments as to what they‚Äôre really thinking in every aspect of your life from business, friendships, dating etc. Now you must learn to do it in Jiu jitsu

"California: When I was in my early twenties I lived briefly with my brother in Huntington Beach California. I loved it then and now at the end of the day at the World Championships we are hanging out back in HB and I still love it now ü§óü§ó The famous Pier still looks great - I spent so much time there many years ago and Saturday night here looks much the same as it did thirty five years ago. I always loved the Pacific Coast Highway. California has a real car culture - American muscle cars and European exotics abound here. This place is awesome üòúüòú

"Two ways of studying Jiu jitsu: One of the beauties of Jiu jitsu is that you can approach it in two very different ways - both of which are very profitable to your development. The first is to study Jiu jitsu as a martial art/combat sport in itself. If you study Jiu jitsu as a stand alone art by itself you can make fast progress and really focus on pure grappling. I still believe after all these years that just Jiu jitsu by itself makes for an extremely effective fighting style. Even a very highly ranked fighter would have to be very wary of a very good Jiu jitsu player who had no MMA training and stay away from certain positions and play a smart tactical game to win. The other approach is to see Jiu Jitsu as a component of a complete fighting style that borrowed from various combat sports to produce a well rounded MMA style that covered everything. This is generally the best approach for fighting but is often not suitable to part timers or older athletes or professionals who simply can‚Äôt risk daily injuries while working a full time job. Here is a nice photo of two great athletes training with the squad who represent well this split. Keenan Cornelius is of course, the specialist who dedicates his time to single discipline Jiu jitsu grappling. Georges St Pierre is the all rounder who uses Jiu jitsu training as a vital component of an overall program as a professional MMA athlete. Both  are wonderful ways to approach the art. I‚Äôve always loved the fact that Jiu Jitsu can adapt to the needs of its followers like this and it has created some amazing memories for me as a coach to see different athletes with different goals working together in their own directions.
"
"Most of the good things in jiu jitsu occur when you misalign yourself with your opponent: It‚Äôs difficult to get most of the moves in Jiu Jitsu when you‚Äôre directly underneath them and lined up with their centerline. Everything gets easier when you shift out to the side a little and get on your side rather than flat on your back. These movements are small and easy to ignore when watching, but they have great significance in improving your performance. In addition this kind of shifting off center is what enables you to enter into moves without flexibility or dexterity and thus are the best hope for less athletic or older practitioners to enter into moves. Next time your feeling stuck start with a shift out to the side and THEN enter your move - you‚Äôll be surprised how small changes can garner big results
"
"Your opponent can never cover all the potential targets: In all combat sports the basic game is to be able to attack vulnerabilities in an opponent whilst defending your own. Sometimes opponents have excellent discipline with their stance and positioning so that it feels impossible to breach their defenses. Take heart - it may seem this way - but it‚Äôs an illusion - there‚Äôs ALWAYS an opening somewhere. The more an opponent focuses his attention on defending one piece of real estate, the more vulnerable he becomes at some other area. If he spreads his defenses over his whole body, he won‚Äôt be able to stop a determined attack anywhere. That‚Äôs the basic dilemma that must guide your target selection. This why is why two things are necessary for you to breach tough defenses. The first is a wide enough array of attacks to cover the whole body. This means you should have at least one strong attack for lower body, upper body and neck from front and back. The second thing you need is the ability to feint an attack in one area to draw his defenses into one zone whilst being able to redirect to another which is now undefended. Don‚Äôt just choose your main attacks randomly. Make sure you have enough variety to cover the whole body from front and back and top to bottom; and on top of that, the ability to trick an opponent into believing that an attack is imminent in one place when in fact you will attack another target. When you have these two elements in your attack game, you will find that even tough defenses that used to shut you out can be breached
"
"Re-learning is much easier than learning: I am often told by students that they fear learning new moves because when they do their performance level falls with their old moves. There is some truth to this. Whenever you focus on something new, it is always to the detriment of something old. You have only so much of an attention span and once you start paying attention to new techniques it‚Äôs normal to feel yourself slipping backwards in the performance of your old moves. Don‚Äôt worry - it‚Äôs much easier to relearn a move then to learn it from scratch. If you aren‚Äôt quite as sharp with an old move that you used to favor because you‚Äôve been focusing on new material, it doesn‚Äôt take long to hone your skills back into shape. Once learned, knowledge is easily recalled. Keep pushing boundaries with your skill set and have faith that you can always bring old skills back to top level with a little renewed focus any time you need them back
"
"Double your success with takedowns: Many students of jiu jitsu see takedowns as a very separate area of study. Indeed, more than a few don‚Äôt study it at all because they don‚Äôt think it is necessary to success in our sport. This is very unfortunate. Even if you pulled guard at the start of every match your jiu jitsu game would STILL benefit immeasurably by learning takedowns. Takedowns have a great second function in Jiu jitsu as a means of reversing/sweeping opponents from guard position. They also chain together extremely well with classical jiu jitsu sweeps - when the sweep fails - follow with a takedown to finish and get the score. Jiu jitsu doesn‚Äôt require that you devote all your energy and training time to standing takedowns, the vast majority of points and submissions occur on the ground, but you should at least aspire to be COMPETENT in this area. It is sad to see athletes who are brilliant is most aspects of jiu jitsu but who cannot perform even rudimentary standing skills other than sitting to guard. Jiu jitsu is a sport whose founding game plan begins with taking conflict to the ground to assert greater control than is possible in standing position. Again, you don‚Äôt have to be a world beater in standing skills/takedowns, but you owe it to yourself to at least be competent. As noted earlier, it‚Äôll make you better both on your feet and as a guard player with an entirely new toolbox
"
"Quintessential Jiu jitsu moves: Do you think there are certain moves that represent the spirit of Jiu jitsu better than others? I‚Äôve always believed that among the various submissions, the TRIANGLE and the REAR STRANGLE are more representative of the ideals of Jiu jitsu than the others. The rear strangle because it represents the Jiu jitsu ideal of ASYMMETRY IN ATTACKING POTENTIAL. A central theme of Jiu jitsu is to get to positions where you can attack your opponent at will, but he cannot attack you in return. Because the rear strangle is innately tied to dominant position, it is extremely difficult for an opponent even to defend himself, forget about attacking you. You on the other hand, can attack with the single most high percentage finishing hold in the sport - it doesn‚Äôt get any better than that. The triangle represents a different ideal of Jiu jitsu - the ideal of FIGHTING YOUR OPPONENTS UPPER BODY WITH YOUR LOWER BODY. The human body is set up in a way where the strength of our lower body is far greater than that of our upper body. If you want to be capable of beating bigger and stronger opponents, you must be able to grapple their upper body with your lower body - the triangle is among the finest examples of this in operation. I love all the major submissions of Jiu jitsu, but these two in particular stand out for their alignment with some of the most fundamental ideals of Jiu jitsu.
