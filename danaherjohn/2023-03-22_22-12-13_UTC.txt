Getting ready: Nicholas Meregali @nicholasmeregali has been showing his immense skills in the gi these last three weeks getting ready for the Pan American Jiu Jitsu tournament this weekend in Orlando Florida. He and @helenajiujitsugirl will both compete this weekend. It’s been a blast going back into the world of gi training after a long period of no Gi specialization! Good Jiu Jitsu is good jiu Jitsu regardless of whether gi  or no gi - if it embodies the spirit of control that leads to submission it’s all good!
