Paradise City: Flying into Las Vegas for next week’s UFC Grappling Invitational on @ufcfightpass featuring @gordonlovesjiujitsu Gordon Ryan vs the great ADCC Champion Vinny Magalhaes @vinnymma along with other New Wave Jiu jitsu standouts Daniel Manasoiu @jiujitsugiant and Oliver Taza @tazagarami who will compete as a welterweight against heavyweights in the Open Weight Tournament! I’ve always loved the flight into Vegas - the surrounding desert is hauntingly beautiful and like the night sky and the ocean has a way of reminding us of our temporal insignificance when compared with the vast time and power that created its expanse. Time to check in and then get ready for a workout! @luke_griffithjj will be flying in soon after winning good and silver yesterday at the IBJJF World Championships to provide a training partner appropriate for such a tough opponent!
