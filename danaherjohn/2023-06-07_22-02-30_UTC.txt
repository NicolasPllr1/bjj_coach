Control begins with grip - if you control an opponents hands, wrists or elbows he will find it very difficult to grip you whilst you have grips on him. If you can get that initial advantage it helps steer the rest of the engagement in your favor. Make a serious study of your initial contact. Don’t just grip for the sake of gripping. Grip with a purpose and a direction. Get control of his hands, wrist or elbows whilst denying him the same and you’ll always be off to a good start.
