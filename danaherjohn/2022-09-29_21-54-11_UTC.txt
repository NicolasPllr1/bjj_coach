The chase: When you begin to get threatening positions on good opponents they will often react by fleeing from the danger. This will create a chase sequence. When you go to chase a fleeing opponent you’ve got two approaches. The first is to match or exceed your opponents speed of escape with speed of your pursuit. Here your success or failure is based on the development of your own speed. The second approach is to focus not on INCREASING YOUR speed, but rather on DECREASING YOUR OPPONENTS speed. Taking certain grips and positioning your bodyweight appropriately can immediately slow down even the most explosive and fast moving opponents. In general the preferred approach is to focus on slowing the other fellow down with positioning and grip rather than trying to outrace opponents, however, Id be liar if I said you’re always going to be able to slow opponents down, so it’s important to develop your acceleration up and off the mat to chase down fleeing opponents. In hard fought matches it’s usually the combination of both that lets you reel in and recapture an opponent in flight.
