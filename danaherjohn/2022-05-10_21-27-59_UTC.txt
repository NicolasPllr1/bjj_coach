Tension: Probably the single biggest issue for most beginning students in sparring is exhaustion. It’s natural to get very tense and stay at near maximum exertion level throughout the match. This will quickly exhaust anyone - even people who are in very good physical condition. Maximum isometric tension is physically exhausting. The key to endurance in sparring is learning to regulate its use. There will be times when you really need near maximum isometric strength, but these times are short and far between. For most of the match you need movement - which is best done in a state of relative relaxation. Only when you go to apply a move against resistance do you need a quick burst of isometric strength. Learn to stay relaxed most of the time and then to turn on tension when needed and most important - when to turn it off - and you will immediately find that you can grapple for longer periods of time without total exhaustion. Here, Luke Griffith is on the point of completing a stranglehold - this is the time for near maximal commitment to isometric tension - but understand that this is the exception rather than the rule. For most of your match time, stay fairly relaxed to save strength for the times you need it, and if you don’t get a speedy breakthrough - turn it off and go back to relaxation - you’ll need it again later
