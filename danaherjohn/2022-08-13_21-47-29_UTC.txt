Multiple lines of attack: When you have but one attack in a given scenario you’ll be successful as long as you are matched against people who don’t know your game. Once you start showing everyone what that attack is however, they’ll learn quickly and develop defenses that stop that one line of attack. That’s why we all have a need to develop multiple lines of attack from all our favorite positions and moves, so that opponents can never know what’s next. Best of all are dilemma/trilemma pairings where one horn of the dilemma creates a reaction that facilitates the other horn of the dilemma and vice versa. One of the very best moves in this regard is the REAR TRIANGLE ushiro sankaku. It creates several dilemmas at once. The first is between the dual threat of strangle and joint locks. The more an opponent resists one, the easier the other becomes. The second is between the various joint locks available, probably more than any other hold. You have juji gatame armlock, kimura, Americana and a nasty wrist lock thrown in for good measure. With all those options it will be very difficult for an opponent to stop them all, even they know it’s among your favorite moves.
