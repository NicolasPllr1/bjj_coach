Don’t stand in front of danger: If someone motioned towards you in a way that conveyed that they intended you throw hard punches at your head - would you stand in place directly in front of them? Of course not, you’d immediately shift off to one side and keep doing so every time they recentered in order to gain some safety. Same thing when you face the danger of a talented opponents legs as you are confronted by his guard. His guard can be as dangerous as punches, and similarly you want to angle off to a side to lessen the danger rather than stand directly in front where the will face the full array of his attacks. Make it a habit - don’t stand directly in front - GET A GRIP AND STEP TO AN ANGLE. Do it early and do it every time and you’ll be a lot safer when confronted by a dangerous guard
