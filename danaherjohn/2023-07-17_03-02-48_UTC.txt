Back in Austin: Just got out from a twenty nine hour flight from Thailand back to Texas. Congratulations again @garrytonon on an epic win that showed as much heart as technique. Now Iâ€™m driving back into Austin and getting ready to get back early to the gym tomorrow for a full day of teaching.  In Jiu jitsu as in life - your skills determine how far youâ€™ll go more than anything else. Every day is another opportunity to improve existing skills and develop new ones - so thatâ€™s where weâ€™ll be. Lots of exiting matches coming up - both gi and no gi - grappling and fighting. Thanks again to @onechampionship for another great show and to all the grappling organizations that allow jiu jitsu students to showcase their skills. Canâ€™t wait to get back in the gym and help get everyone ready - letâ€™s make some waves!! ðŸ˜œðŸ˜œ
