I am very pleased to announce the release today of my latest instructional video NEW WAVE CLOSED GUARD: BUILDING A COMPLETE CLOSED GUARD SYSTEM. In it I show all the most important and high percentage attacks without the Gi in the modern game. The emphasis is on showing how the unusual amount of distance control, hip control and off balances from closed guard allow a much more systematized approach than the more chaotic open guard scenarios. This allows a step by step procedure attacking an opponent on their knees or standing with a very aggressive array of upper body into lower body submissions mixed with positional attacks. In addition I cover how shorter, stockier athletes can use tactics to make closed guard work effectively for them. Closed guard will always be a foundation of jiu jitsu and with good reason - no other bottom position offers the same degree of overall initial control over an opponents movement and balance. If you want to make it part of your no gi game, take a look! Link in my Instagram bio
