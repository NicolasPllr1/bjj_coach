Increasing your opportunities by changing your angle or orientation: It’s very difficult to attack through the front door on a defensively sound opponent. Their entire stance is set up relative to your current position and location to stop you being able to execute any attacks. However, if you were to change the angle or orientation of your body relative to him, then his stance will need to be changed to address the change you’ve made - and in the time he makes that change he will be open to attack. Sometimes it’s just a matter of getting a small angle on an opponent, other times it’s about totally changing your body orientation - one of the most common and effective means of doing this is to completely invert your body. This completely changes the relationship between your positioning and his and can open big avenues of attack. Get used to inverting under an opponent - moves that seemed impossible just a few seconds before suddenly become a lot easier
