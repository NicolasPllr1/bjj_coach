Strong performance at East Coast ADCC trials in Atlantic City!  Team New Wave had a fine performance at the hotly contested ADCC East Coast trials today and yesterday. Big Daniel Manasoiu @jiujitsugiant led the charge with a 100% submission rate through to gold medal and winning his spot into the big show - ADCC 2024!  Dominick Mejia @dominatormejia had an incredible showing - he performed like a human highlight reel over two days with many dramatic matches and dynamic moves. He won silver in a truly memorable display. Helena Crevar @helenajiujitsugirl won all her matches by submission leading up to final but lost via takedown and negative pull in an action packed final - another amazing performance overall by this outstanding teenage prodigy that will only help direct her training for what is clearly an exceptional future. Oliver Taza won bronze in the ultra competitive 77kg division with many outstanding submissions along the way. Several of the other youngsters had great displays that point to a bright future ahead. Now we will all head back to Austin for preparations for upcoming shows and ultimately West Coast trials. Hope you all enjoyed the show!!
