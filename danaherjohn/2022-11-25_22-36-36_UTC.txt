Two is better than one: When it comes to taking an opponent down the most successful methods in Jiu jitsu are tackles to the legs, in particular single legs and double legs. Single legs are generally easier to enter into - it’s generally easier to grab one leg than two, but single legs are notoriously difficult to finish on well trained, athletic opponents who can maintain their balance and counter. The great advantage of getting to both legs is that it makes it so much harder for an opponent to maintain their balance long enough for an effective counter. You can get the best of both worlds by using the single leg to get an initial grip and then quickly transition to a double leg. This makes use the prime virtue of single legs - ease of entry; and the prime virtue of double legs ease of finishing, whilst avoiding their respective difficulties. Make a habit of getting to a leg and then quickly getting to the second leg and you’ll find a lot more success getting tough opponents down to the mat!
