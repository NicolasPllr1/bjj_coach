Don’t be satisfied: When you stop an opponents move in its tracks it’s always a good feeling, but don’t be satisfied with good when great is right around the corner. As soon as you stopped an opponent’s move, switch your mindset from defense to offense and take advantage of the fact that whenever a move fails your opponents posture will almost always be compromised. This make your offense much easier. So program yourself to attack in that window of opportunity. When you stop your opponent - don’t stop yourself - this is the time to move immediately into your own attack!
