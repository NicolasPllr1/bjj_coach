Different speeds: One of the clearest differentiators between novice and expert in Jiu jitsu is the ability of experts to VARY THE SPEED AND INTENSITY of the game at will to match their purpose. Most beginners have only one speed - maximum. They quickly find this is exhausting and if you don’t know what you’re doing, just gets you into bad position slightly faster than if you slowed down a little. One of the first signs of progress is the ability to slow their pace down to a speed that enables them to make considered choices and solve problems. Over time they will learn to play at many different speeds and to vary their speed many times over the course of the match. Here, Nicholas Meregali shows his mastery of speed variations with a relaxed pace just moments before he stepped out to win a tough match at the recent IBJJF World Championships. He went effortlessly from this relaxed pace to a full intensity competition match at the highest level without interruption. This kind of mastery of variation of pace and intensity is at the core of Jiu jitsu mastery. Just as modern cars benefit from having many more gears than old fashioned cars to create smoother and more efficient power, so too you will benefit from having many jiu jitsu gears to suit the many situations you will find yourself in.
