Big Dan Manasoiu wins Emerald City grappling event in Atlantic City in fine form! @jiujitsugiant Daniel Manasoiu, the twenty one year old recent purple belt went on a submission spree under EBI rules to win in impressive fashion. Mr Manasoiu has been working very hard in his game here in Austin TX. His submission repertoire is expanding and his tactical sense improving. It’s great to see this young man’s  results reflecting his hard work. Well done Daniel!!
