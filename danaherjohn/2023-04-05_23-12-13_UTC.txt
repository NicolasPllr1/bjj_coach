If you want to win more - use your feet more! The game of Jiu jitsu is primarily fought with hips legs and feet and only secondarily with shoulders, arms and hands. Make sure always that your training and technique selection reflects this fundamental fact. The more you actively seek to use your feet to connect, move and off balance opponents - the more success youâ€™ll have. We spend the majority of our lives in a hand dominant world - but the world of Jiu jitsu is foot dominant - make sure you play like it
