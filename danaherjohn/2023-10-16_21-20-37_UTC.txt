Jiu Jitsu exhibits the characteristics of both art and science: We usually make a pretty strong distinction between arts and science - look at any academic institution and you’ll see that they are divided quite strongly into different faculties. Jiu Jitsu however, seems to have a foot in both departments. Insofar as it is a mechanical skill, based largely around making your body (and your opponents) into levers, fulcrums, wedges (incline planes) etc - it’s a scientific endeavor with objectively true and false answers to the questions we pose about technique. Insofar as it’s up to our choice as to which techniques we will employ and in what fashion, it’s a case of self expression where there is no right or wrong answer as to how one ought to act. Seen in this light it’s clear that there are times when there is a clear right and wrong way of playing the game, but just as many other times when there isn’t and that knowing the difference between the mechanical/scientific aspects of Jiu jitsu and the artistic/expressionist aspects is important for both teacher and student.
