Make your opponent carry your weight whenever you can. Try also to make sure that when he carries your weight, he does so in a mechanically inefficient way so that he has to use muscles to carry the weight rather than sound structure/stance. This will tire him quickly. If you can make this a habit youâ€™ll quickly fatigue opponents and a tired opponent is much easier to control and submit
