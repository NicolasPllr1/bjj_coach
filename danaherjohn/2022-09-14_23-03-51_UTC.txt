If you can preserve your BALANCE, then you can see and react well to every threat and at a moment’s notice launch your own attacks. If you can preserve your COMPOSURE then you can make good decisions even under stress. If you can preserve your BREATHING you can outlast an opponent who matches you in skill and strength. Keep your balance, your composure and your breathing under control whilst denying them to your opponent and you’ll find victory far more often than not.
