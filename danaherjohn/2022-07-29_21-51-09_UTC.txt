If you can control an opponents movement - you control the game: Moving targets are hard to hit. When you can stick an opponent in place and immobilize him, you can hit him with a submission hold at will. What makes the ground game so interesting is that the floor limits the means and methods by which we can move into a few predictable patterns. Once you learn those patterns you can learn to shut them down - and if you can shut down movement while still able to move yourself - you can finish anyone. When you grapple focus less on trying to perform moves and more on learning how people move on the ground and how you can interfere with that. Then all the moves you were previously focused upon become considerably easier
