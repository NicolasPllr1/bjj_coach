Submission goals: Your arsenal of submissions is a big part of defining your overall game. Which ones you choose to be your main weapons is up to you - but what is NOT up to you is the areas your submissions must cover. You must have at least one lower body joint lock, one upper body joint lock and one strangle from front and one strangle from back and one (either lock or strangle) that you can do from a scramble situation. This is is your minimum requirement. Again, you get to choose which ones you adopt, but thereâ€™s no choice in application areas - you HAVE to be competent in all these!
