Staying compact: This is a sport that generally punishes extension. In general you’re better off in most situations keeping your elbows and knees close to your core and to each other. If you just work with this simple desiderata in mind - KEEP YOUR ELBOWS AND KNEES CLOSE TOGETHER AND CLOSE TO YOUR BODY - you’ll do better on the mats. As you grow in sophistication you’ll add the idea of inside positioning but that’s a longer story for a another day. Stay compact and you’ll stay alive - stay alive and you’re always in the fight!
