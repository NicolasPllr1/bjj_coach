Attacking the whole body: The single most important factor in how effective your attacks will be is their mechanical efficiency. If your attacks are mechanically weak they simply won’t have sufficient power to have any effect on an opponent. Close behind mechanical considerations however is the notion of DIVERSITY OF ATTACKS. If you attack only one part of the body you become predictable and your opponent will have an easy time anticipating you and putting up strong defenses in the specific area you are focusing your attacks. ONLY WHEN YOU ATTACK THE WHOLE BODY CAN YOU SCATTER YOUR OPPONENTS DEFENSES. Once his attention is pulled into one zone it’s easy to attack another. You don’t a vast array of attacks - just enough to have one or two good attacks to lower body, upper body and head/neck. It’s not so much the NUMBER of attacks you have, as your ability to target the whole body and shift rapidly from one target area to another that will determine your effectiveness. Attacks on the left will always set up attacks on the right, attacks to the upper body will disguise subsequent attacks to the lower body - this the nature of good jiu jitsu and martial arts in general
