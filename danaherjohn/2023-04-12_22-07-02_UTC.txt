Any time you get your arms cinched around the neck and one arm whether from front or back or side, you’ve got a truly formidable control that is also very close to several submissions. Look for it when ever you can - it’s almost always available from any neutral or dominant position other than closed guard or open guards where the opponent can control distance. Once attained - you immediately become a true menace to your opponent and he will have to get defensive immediately. It’s a rather simple grip to apply (though controlling it for long periods of time against a skilled opponent isn’t so easy) that costs you little in terms of risk and effort and yields great rewards - look for it every time you spar!
