Express yourself: When you hear me talk about jiu jitsu you might think I believe it’s all soulless mechanics, physics and rational decision making - a cold science. I do believe that these are the main factors that make jiu jitsu effective. Let’s be clear however, Jiu jitsu has the features of both science AND art. It is scientific insofar as mechanical and biomechanical laws are the core of its operations. However, all jiu jitsu involves the element of CHOICE. You choose among competing options as to what you will do on the mat. These choices will be a reflection of your body type and personality. They will inevitably be a form of SELF EXPRESSION. The most important thing is that your expression be AUTHENTIC. Let your game be a true reflection of who you are. Don’t try to emulate another person - you just end up looking like a bad copy. Don’t worry about what shape your authentic self expression will take - it will grow organically over time as naturally as your body grew from childhood to adulthood. Just as no one had to tell your body how to grow, neither will anyone have to tell you how your personal game will grow - it will do so all by itself over time.
