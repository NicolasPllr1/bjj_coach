Isolating limb: One of the core concepts of Jiu jitsu is that of attacking a vulnerable point of an opponents body with a larger percentage of your physical resources than he can muster with his physical resources. This means isolating a single limb and locking it with a substantial part of your body - preferably the legs and hips. Pinning an opposition good, but what will make you great is the action of going beyond pinning the torso and isolating a limb so that you get to the greatest goal of submission. Constantly look for opportunities to isolate a limb and surround it with your legs and hips - this is the path to ideal Jiu jitsu
