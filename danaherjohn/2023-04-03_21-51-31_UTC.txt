Turning good into great: Positional dominance is a wonderful thing in Jiu Jitsu. It is very important however, that you adopt a maximizing mindset with regards positioning. Don’t settle for a GOOD position when a GREAT position is well within your reach. Here, Helena Crevar @helenajiujitsugirl has gotten to the mounted position - that’s very good - but she does not settle for good - note how she focuses on walking her opponents arm up into extension that takes the position from good to great and opens up many submission holds. Take the extra time to take your favorite pins from good to great and you’ll take your game overall from good to great!
