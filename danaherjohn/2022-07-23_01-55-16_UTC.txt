Plotting your next move: One of the most useful abilities to develop in Jiu jitsu is that of temporarily STOPPING THE ACTION and taking a short break. This gives you the ability to PLOT THE NEXT MOVE. It can be difficult to make constructive progress if youâ€™re just always in high gear hustling after a opponent. You can burn a lot of energy and have nothing to show for it. Often you do better by using a pattern where you apply a short intense burst of energy to attain a position that allows you to take a short breather whilst exercising sufficient control to retain that position, then figuring out your next stop, working hard to attain that new resting point and continuing this pattern until the job is done. If your hearts racing and lungs burning, keep working to get a holding position and then take a break. While you and your opponent take a short reprieve your body rests but your mind is still working - figuring out the next pit stop - and then going back to physical work. Work like this and you can grapple a long time and make consistent forward progress
