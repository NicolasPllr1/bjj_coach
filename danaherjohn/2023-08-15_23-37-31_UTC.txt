Height: Winning a battle for height will often prove to be of the greatest importance in certain situations in Jiu jitsu. Sometimes you win by getting higher and on top of an opponent - sometimes you win by getting lower and underneath the center of gravity of an opponent - which one you choose will be dependent on what you’re trying to achieve and what your opponent presents to you. What won’t change however, is the need to threaten both against good opponents. Fake going high and then dive underneath - or threaten going under and then quickly pop up on top. It’s the dual threat that always does best!!
