Homeward bound: At Austin airport waiting for my plane for the long haul to Australia to see Mom (Mum) and family. Itâ€™s been a long time! Looking forward also to seeing jiu jitsu friends old and new and doing my best to help out the burgeoning Australian jiu jitsu scene! One day when I get some time I will go the land where I was raised, New Zealand - I miss the beauty of that great Island where I grew up. This will be a thirty hour flight when all is said and done - I hope Iâ€™ve still got what it takes to hit the ground running ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ More likely I will have to be dragged off the plane unconscious and mumbling incoherently about grappling moves ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ See you there!
