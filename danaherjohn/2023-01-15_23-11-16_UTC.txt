Helena Crevar - an outstanding talent: Recently a very talented female teenage athlete, @helenajiujitsugirl Helena Crevar, just fifteen years old, began training with us in Austin Texas. She has applied herself very well, rapidly making the shift to twice a day daily training and showing very admirable maturity and determination on the training mats. She has very supportive parents who come to every session and offer a very impressive level of support. Yesterday she had her first local competition against an adult 2x world champion and won in over time via takedown - despite only working takedowns upon her arrival here in Texas a relatively short time ago, showing her hard work and excellent learning ability combined with her excellent ability to apply knowledge under pressure on stage in match conditions against strong opponents. Well done Helena! Here she is in victory and then hanging out with fellow New Wave junior phenoms Luke Griffith @luke_griffithjj and Davis Asare @davis_asare after the win!
