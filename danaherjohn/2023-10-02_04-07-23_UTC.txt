Victory in Houston!! Gordon Ryan put on a grappling clinic against the great Brazilian champion Patrick Guadio here in Houston in the main event of WNO Grappling Event tonight. Once again he called the method victory - arm bar (juji gatame) - an incredible feat against such a powerful opponent. Along the way he showcased his pressure passing style and pin transitions/control that make him such a difficult opponent to stop. Also tonight there were three very impressive title matches. Brazilian superstars Mica Galvao and Baby Shark had great wins against very talented opponents and Elisabeth Clay defeated Brianna St Marie in an extremely tightly contested match to win her title. Another great night for grappling - I hope you all enjoyed the show!!
