Victory in Poland! Outstanding squad juniors Dan Manasoiu @jiujitsugiant and Luke Griffith @luke_griffithjj punched their tickets to the worlds biggest grappling show at ADCC World Championships 2022. Both of the blue and purple belt youngsters put on outstanding performance, winning three of their four matches via submission against much more experienced black belt opponents, winning the outstanding team trophy in addition to their very impressive individual performances. The amount of progress these two have made since beginning their training in Texas has been remarkable and culminated in their superb performance today. Now itâ€™s time for them to prepare for the biggest show of their lives later this year! Well done Luke and Dan!
