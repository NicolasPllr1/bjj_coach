Starting up in Boston: My journey into instructional videos at BJJ Fanatics was helped immensely by my good friend and student, Placido Santos @placisantos who proved to be an outstanding demonstration partner (uke) and then student. If ever there was positive proof that instructionals can have a greatly beneficial effect on your game it was this young man. He went from a raw beginner to an excellent competitor and teacher in a very short time working on and from the videos we made together. As his skill level climbed he made regular trips to NYC to train with the squad in the basement, then Puerto Rico and now Austin Texas. The proof of his progress came at the last US ADCC trials where he was one of the outstanding athletes. Now Placido has made his jiu jitsu dreams a reality by opening his own school in the Boston/Westborough area! It is called @5stonesjiujitsu I taught a seminar in Puerto Rico just after the squad broke up to help out the little local school that had hosted us for the year - Placido wowed the local Jiu Jitsu crowd with the excellence of his teaching - I was extremely proud of his performance. If you want to learn modern jiu jitsu in the Boston/Westborough area with superb attention to detail and depth of knowledge - this is the place you want to go! Check it out - I always do when Iâ€™m there ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡µðŸ‡·
