Pushing past resistance: Everything you do in jiu jitsu, you do against resistance. Your opponent knows most of your moves and the counters to them. Learning to overcome resistance is one of the great keys to consistently good performances on the mat. When it comes to dealing with resistance there is a middle path that you must learn to steer. You don’t want to quit on a move at the first sign of resistance - you’ll never complete any moves that way. Nor do you want to persist so long on a move that’s been stopped that you exhaust yourself or fall into a trap. Finding that middle found is a lifelong journey. You can learn a move in minutes but it’ll take you years to figure out when to persist with it and when to switch to something else when applying it against a resisting opponent. Make sure you pair your moves with another move that works in the opposite direction. That way you play them against each other when you encounter resistance. Then is just a matter of experimenting over time to see how far you should go with one until you switch to the other.
