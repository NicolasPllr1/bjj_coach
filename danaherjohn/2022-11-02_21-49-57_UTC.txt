When youâ€™re winning - take your time: In Jiu jitsu it pays to get out of bad situations as quickly as possible. The longer you stay there, the worse things typically get. Good situations on the other hand, allow you to take your time. In most cases good position creates enervating pressure, so the longer you dwell there, the better things get. So as a general rule - when things are bad, move quickly to rectify them; when things are good - slow things down and let time and pressure work in your favor so that you can turn a good situation into a great one
