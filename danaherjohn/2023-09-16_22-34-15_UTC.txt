Luke Griffith victorious in Poland! Outstanding South African jiu jitsu student Luke Griffith punched his ticket to the biggest show in grappling today at the European ADCC trials in Poland. Luke won the under 99kg division with a 100% submission rate - incredible for such a high level tournament. He has trained so diligently over the last year and despite ups and downs with injuries he came through today in outstanding style and guarantee his place in Las Vegas ADCC IN 2024. Daniel Manasoiu and Oliver Taza both won silver in their divisions and will go the next trials with a lot of confidence given the strength of their performances and the high submission/dominance they showed prior to finals. Congratulations Luke - itâ€™s great also to see African jiu jitsu getting stronger and the growing internationalization of the sport!
