As long as you’ve got a foot and leg between you and your opponent you’ve got a line of defense and counter offense: Sometimes you feel your opponent has gotten a move on you and you’ll have to concede a score. Be confident that as long as you’ve got a leg between you then you can use it to elevate and opponent, create and maintain space, establish some degree of control through connection and use this to first stop an opponent and even counter them. Sometimes what seems like a tenuous line of defense can turn out to be surprisingly effective!
