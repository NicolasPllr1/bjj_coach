I am very happy to announce the release today of my latest instructional video AGELESS JIU JITSU: WINNING WHEN YOUâ€™RE OLDER OR LESS ATHLETIC. This video is designed to help jiu jitsu players who feel compromised by either their age or a lack of athletic background and who find performing many of the moves of Jiu jitsu problematic but still want to be effective. There are certain moves, positions and tactics that can enable older or slower, less mobile players to be very effective against younger, fitter opponents - this video lays out a game plan for exactly that. I always felt that this was an area I could help people with since I am approaching late fifties in age and I have a crippled leg that always severely compromised my mobility on the mats. Despite that I was able to develop a game that made me quite effective and I would like to be able to do the same for other people. If you feel like age or a lack of athletic background is affecting your learning, maybe check it out and see if it can help! Link in my Instagram bio
