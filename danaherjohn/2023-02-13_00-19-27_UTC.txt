The incredible efficiency and power of foot sweeps (ashi waza): Oliver Taza shows how effective a well applied foot sweep can be last night as he won the Enigma Grappling belt. Just as we all stumble and fall when walking and we trip over an obstacle; so too, if you can get an opponent moving and trip/block his foot mid step, you can stumble him down to the mat (Sasae Tsuri Komi Ashi). The beauty of the these moves is their efficiency. When they work it’s like a magic trick. Relatively little effort and risk for a great potential reward - now that’s good jiu jitsu!
