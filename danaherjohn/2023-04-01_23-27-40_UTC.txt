Young guns in Liverpool: The New Wave juniors have been on a rampage in local Jiu jitsu and now theyâ€™re going international. @luke_griffithjj Luke Griffith, @jiujitsugiant Dan Manasoiu, @davis_asare Davis Asare and teenage phenom @landonelmorebjj Landon Elmore traveled to Liverpool,England this week to compete in @grapplefest Mr Griffith was fighting for the 100kg Belt. All four athletes won via submission - three heel hooks and an arm bar! Luke won the title via heel hook, Dan won with his trademark heel hook, Davis via a well controlled arm bar and Landon via highlight reel flying kani basami into heel hook. Amazing work again from these hard working athletes!!
