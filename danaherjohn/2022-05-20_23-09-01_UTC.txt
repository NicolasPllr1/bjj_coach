The long way home: Back at Changi Airport in Singapore getting ready for the thirty hour journey home. Sorry to say Garryâ€™s match did not go well last night. His opponent Tye Ruotolo secured a perfect Darce strangle early in the match and won via submission in outstanding fashion. Congratulations to both Ruotolo twins on outstanding debut performances in OneChampionship last night - they both showed very clearly they have arrived at the very highest levels of the sport. Congratulations also to @onechampionship for putting in another outstanding show. It was an honor to be among so many of the very grapplers and Muay Thai fighters last night. OneChampionship has been doing an incredible job of getting the best of the various martial arts disciplines under their banner and giving them an exciting framework to showcase their skills. As they say, your worth is not measured by whether you fall or not, but by how you respond to a fall. There have been some very very interesting matches signed back in the States - the good news is that Iâ€™ve got thirty uninterrupted hours to figure out how to get athletes ready for them ðŸ˜œðŸ˜‚. Looking forward to getting back to Texas and back on the mats to help everyone get ready!
