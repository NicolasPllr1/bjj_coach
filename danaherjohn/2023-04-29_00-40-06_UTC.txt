Pressure will always reveal your weaknesses: I am often asked by students what they need to work on - the best way to assess what you need to work on is to spar with a partner who can subject you to severe pressure. Just as water poured into a vessel will immediately reveal a leak, and a great weight will immediately reveal a weak link in a chain - so too, pressure will break your game at its weakest point and tell you immediately what you need to work on. I don’t recommend subjecting yourself too often to great pressure, but it’s definitely something you need periodically to show you were you need to do the most work for the future.
