The mount as a grappling pin: The mounted position is the most desired position in classical Jiu jitsu. This is because classical Jiu jitsu is FIGHTING Jiu jitsu. The mount is the best pin for striking an opponent with fists and elbows - given that Jiu jitsu Beas originally conceived as a fighting art of self defense this made perfect sense. But what about modern sport Jiu jitsu that does not allow strikes of any kind? Should the mount still be held in highest regard among the pins? Of all the frontal/ chest to chest pins I still believe the answer is yes. This is because not only is the mount best for striking, it is also the best for smothering pressure that disrupts breathing. The mount aligns your torso with an opponents and as such creates great opportunities for smothering pressure - far more so than side or north south pins or knee on stomach. As such even in a pure grappling match, the mount should always be a goal once you pass an opponents guard. The kind of pressure the mount can generate creates reactions in your opponents that facilitate submission holds. Learn to use the mount for what it is - an intimidating, smothering pin that can break the defensive discipline of even the toughest opponents in ways that open them up more readily for the true goal of Jiu jitsu - submission
