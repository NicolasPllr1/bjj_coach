Attrition: Technical skills are the main basis of victory, but never underestimate the value of TACTICAL considerations in determining victor and loser. Itâ€™s not just about skill level. In a surprising number of instances the more skilled athlete may lose to the less skilled. If your tactics are superior you can reliably make the other guy work harder than you so that while you are TIRED he is EXHAUSTED. Build your skills, they will be your main weapons, but never forget that a weapon is only as effective as the user who employs it - only when skills are employed in line with sound tactics will they be decisive in determining the outcome of a match.
