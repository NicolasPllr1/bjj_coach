Take away your opponents ability to resist one step at a time: The game of Jiu jitsu is all about first degrading your opponents offensive abilities (by taking him to the ground and securing top position either by takedown or sweep and then getting past his legs into dominant upper body pins) and then degrading his defensive abilities. A key part of this second aim is to pin your opponents arms down so that he has to defend himself with only one arm (and in some cases - no arms). This truly has an impact on an opponents ability to defend himself. It’s hard enough to defend a bad position at the best of times, when one of your arms is trapped it’s even worse. Once you’ve taken away an opponents offensive ability - train yourself to to go further and undermine his defensive abilities. Understand that this usually means some kind of trapping of his arm(s). It doesn’t take much to do this - but it adds a LOT to your ability to slice through the toughest defenses and get a submission victory!
