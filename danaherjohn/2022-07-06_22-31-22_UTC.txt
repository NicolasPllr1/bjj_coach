Gravity: There is no doubt that the use of gravity has big effects on the outcome of matches. Most people think gravity helps the top athlete - after all, if I’m on top gravity naturally creates a sense of weight and pressure that can immobilize and exhaust an opponent. It is however, crucial that you understand that gravity can work in the bottom athletes favor as well. Instead of weight pressure and weight, the bottom athlete focuses on off balancing the opponent. Once balance has been broken, gravity will create an immediate stumbling and falling effect that makes subsequent attacks easy. Gravity itself doesn’t change - it helps both the top and the bottom athlete equally - just in different ways. Make sure you know and understand them both so that gravity is not your friend when you’re on top but your enemy when you’re on bottom, but rather, your trusted friend regardless of where you are
