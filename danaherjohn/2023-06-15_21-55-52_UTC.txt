What’s next? This is a sport of moves. We learn moves and try to apply them against opponents who also know the moves and their counters. We persist until either we or our opponent gets the breakthrough. Who wins in these situations is usually determined by who integrates moves together best. If we both know the moves and counters it’s going to be the one who sets moves up and combines them better into sequences that are difficult to follow for an opponent. Accordingly, focus on the move you’re currently performing but make sure in the back of your mind you’ve got at least one and no more than three follow up moves mapped out and ready to be employed. Don’t focus on the next move so much that your performance of the current move degenerates to a level where it simply won’t be effective, but just enough that there won’t be a delay in transitioning to that next move should the current one fail.
