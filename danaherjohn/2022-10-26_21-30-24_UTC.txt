Two of the best martial artists I ever met: We had the pleasure of hosting one of the greatest MMA fighters of all time, Demetrius Mighty Mouse Johnson @mighty and the most well rounded overall warrior I ever met, Tim Kennedy @timkennedymma They bring a totally different game to the mats but as all great martial artist do, they find the way to use their body type to best effect. Mr Johnson was always one of the most creative and intelligent fighters in MMA and his grappling is absolutely superb also - his movement on the mats is really something to behold! Working out with them was @juanjiujitsu one of our youngsters who came with us from our year in Puerto Rico - it was a great experience for him to practice with two of his idols! In an age of grappling specialists itâ€™s so impressive to see just how good at grappling many of the top MMA athletes are at grappling and how well they stay abreast of the changing grappling game despite their need to practice many disciplines as MMA all rounders.
