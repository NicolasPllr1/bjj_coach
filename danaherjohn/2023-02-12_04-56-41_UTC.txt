Chasing dreams in Austin: Oliver Taza @tazagarami and Helena Crevar @helenajiujitsugirl along with Davis Asare @davis_asare led the New Wave team to a great night of local Jiu jitsu here in Austin. Oliver and Helena won title belts at the @enigmajiujitsuofficial Enigma Grappling show. Many of the juniors competed tonight and gained the valuable experience needed to go from small to great over time. Itâ€™s always great to watch them go out and apply what they train so hard to do every day in the gym! Congratulations everyone - back at it again tomorrow!
