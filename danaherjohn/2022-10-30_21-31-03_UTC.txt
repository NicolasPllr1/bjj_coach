Your two biggest positional goals - the back and the mount: When you first begin Jiu jitsu you get introduced to the basics of the positional game and taught the idea of position before submission. This is a great way to start your development. As times by you can get much sophisticated and start breaking down positions, grips and control into very finely distinguished categories. It’s important however to have some simplicity to give you a basic sense of direction no matter how complex things get. MAKE YOUR TWO POSITIONAL GOALS THE MOUNT AND THE REAR MOUNT. You can never go wrong with that. They are the two highest scoring positions in the sport and the two positions that beat create the physical and tactical pressure that result in submission. From your first days in jiu jitsu until your last - make the mount and rear mount your goal every time you train and compete and you’ll always know where you’re headed and give yourself the best chance of victory
