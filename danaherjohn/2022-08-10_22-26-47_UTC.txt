You are the average of your best offensive moves and your worst defensive moves: Your ability on the mat overall has two crucial parameters. The ability of your best offensive moves to break through and score/finish; and your worst defensive moves that enable and opponent to score/finish you. You aren’t measure purely by your best offense and you aren’t measured by your worst defense but rather the average of the two. You therefore have a responsibility to bring both as high as possible to increase your effectiveness overall. If you have good offense but gaping holes in your defense your average will be lower than it ought to be; similarly when your defense is rock solid but your offense is weak. Bring your average up by working on both areas and never neglecting one for the other.
