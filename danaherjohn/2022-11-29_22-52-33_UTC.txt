Stopping an opponents move doesn’t end the story - it STARTS the story: too often athletes will do good work stopping an opponents move and then subconsciously fall into mode of thinking whereby they think they’ve done enough and settle into neutral position. Don’t congratulate yourself for stopping a move - that’s exactly when some of the greatest attacking opportunities arise - that’s when things start to get interesting. Remember - the basis of your opponents defense is always his STANCE. At the moment you’ve stopped his move his stance will be temporarily broken, making offense MUCH easier. That’s why you should see the act of stopping an opponents move not merely as a successful defense, but also as one of the best possible times to launch into offense. When an opponent’s stance is compromised - and it almost always will be after a stopped attack - that’s when the chances of a successful attack are highest since there is so much less to have to fight through to complete your counterattack. So turn your mind in the direction of attack every time you stop an opponent’s attacking move - you’ll be pleasantly surprised how much easier attacks become
