Time and change: When I was coaching Georges St Pierre many years ago at the peak of his MMA career two of his toughest rivals were  scrap pack legends Jake Shields @jakeshields and Nick Diaz @nickdiaz209 They were some of the most difficult opponents to game plan and prepare for due to their great skill sets. Now years later it was great to have them join the squad for grappling workouts while we were in Las Vegas recently. They both still have extremely impressive skills! Life has a strange and wonderful way of creating intense rivalries that fade with time and get replaced by the realization that we all have much more in common with each other than we have differences. I was struck by how different the personalities of Jake, Nick and Georges were in some ways, but in the ways that count for Jiu jitsu, they were very similar!
