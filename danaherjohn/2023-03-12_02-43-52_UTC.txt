Working towards dreams: Outstanding New Wave juniors @davis_asare and @helenajiujitsugirl had great performances here in Austin today. Mr Asare won his tournament in his usual convincing style and Ms Crevar continued her amazing run by winning the brown belt title via stranglehold from mount - an incredible feat for a sixteen year old developing athlete. It’s great to see this path - starting local, building skills and experience that will enable to take successive steps to higher and higher levels until you’re where you once dreamed of being. I watched this progression in a young Georges St Pierre and Gordon Ryan and it’s the path you must all follow on your own journey in whatever quest you’ve assigned yourself. Build a dream, create a plan and follow it long enough to see it become reality!
