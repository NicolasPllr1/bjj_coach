Counting down: Tomorrow night in Austin Texas @flograppling will host a fantastic night of grappling. Headlining the event will be a bout between two jiu jitsu icons - Kaynan Duarte and Nicholas Meregali. This will be their first no gi encounter. Mr Meregali is a pyrotechnical submission hunter - one of the best in the sports history - but Mr Duarte is one of the best athletes in the sports history and a superb tactician who has two ADCC gold medals to prove it - this will be a great match! Teenage phenom Helena Crevar will take on exciting Australian grappling prospect Healy Dayan a student of Australian grappling legend Lachlan Giles who now trains at B team - she has shown a very strong positional game in competition here in the US so this match should be excellent! Oliver Taza will take on Sebastian Rodriguez on short notice. Oliver has been on fire in ADCC Open competition and will bring that good form to the arena tomorrow. There are many other great matches on the card featuring legends like Felipe Pena, Nicky Ryan and Dante Leon - keep your eyes on this one - it will be ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥
