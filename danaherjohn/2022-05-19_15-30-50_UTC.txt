Martial arts in Asia: It’s always fascinating getting ready for a show in Asia. There is a deep cultural association with the study of martial arts that goes far back into history. Here we are in a shopping mall on the way to the gym and there are statues of Shaolin monks practicing their skills! Up the street there is a small monastery running Kung fu classes. The crowds at events have a good grasp of what the athletes are trying to do at events and a deep appreciation for the athletes. Our study of jiu jitsu in America is largely as a competitive sport where the emphasis is entirely on mechanical efficiency, tactics and athletic preparation. These are here in Asia too of course, but there is also a fascinating association with cultural and religious tradition that gives it a different flavor than the way we practice in the West - however hard it is to pin down and define, it’s unmistakable when you’re here and always a delight. It’s been great feeling the summer humidity and afternoon rain storms of Asia and the Pacific - it’s a feeling I always associate with my travels here and the first thing you feel when you step off the plane. Now it’s time to get ready for the big show at @onechampionship tomorrow night - there is a mix of truly high level jiu jitsu, kick boxing and Muay Thai - it’s going to be a great show!
