You step on the mat alone: In Jiu jitsu and in life - you’re always surrounded by people offering advice and ideas - that’s fine. Most of the time they have good intentions and sometimes the advice is very helpful. Understand however, that it’s you and not them who has to do your work so make sure it’s your own inner voice that does most of the talking in your pre match time rather than the voices coming from the outside. You’ve got a skill set and a game plan based upon your body type and personality that’s been developing a long time - don’t compromise it by following commands from other personalities and body types that conflict with what you’ve built. Always seek to express who YOU are rather than other peoples conceptions of who you might be.
