Filming in Boston! It’s been great as always working with two of my favorite students Brian Glick @bzglick and Placido Santos @placisantos on a new video in the gi! It’s crazy cold here in Boston with a big snowfall today - it’s been a long time since I walked in heavy snow! Now it’s time for dinner and then back to work tomorrow!
