Isolation: Jiu jitsu is the art and science of control that leads to submission - and submission requires the ISOLATION of a vulnerable target (joints and blood supply to the brain) that can be attacked through the use of the leverage of your own limbs. Arguably the best of these acts of isolating targets are those where the LEGS are used to isolate targets in the upper body. This keeps your game in line with a fundamental feature of the human body - the fact that the legs are inherently stronger than the limbs of the upper body. A smaller and weaker persons legs will be stronger than a bigger and stronger persons arms and neck. Staying true to this principle is a good way for smaller, weaker people to defeat bigger, stronger people. One of the best examples of this principle are TRIANGLES and ARM BARS (juji gatame), as they use your legs to control the opponents head and shoulders. Taller, longer athletes generally develop an affinity more for triangles; shorter, stockier athletes typically develop an affinity more for arm bars. Take your pick - but remember the principles - your legs vs your opponents upper body - isolate the targets and youâ€™ll be a dangerous opponent for even bigger and stronger adversaries
