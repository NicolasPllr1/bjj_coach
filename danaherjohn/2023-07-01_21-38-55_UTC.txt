A path in the wilderness: Jiu jitsu sparring can seem like a confusing mess as you get twisted upside down, left, right and every which way. The add to that the thousands of different options you could use, but every time the thought of applying one of them occurs to you the situation changes so rapidly that now the opportunity is gone and you’ve to choose again. This is why it’s so important to have a small set of major or favorite moves (tokui-waza). When everything seems confused, they bring order back into the picture. If you know where you need to be in order to execute a move that you really believe can win it for you - you’ll find a way to get there. As a light house guides a ship in the darkness, so too, a move that you understand well and have faith in will guide you towards it no matter how confused your situation in a match.
