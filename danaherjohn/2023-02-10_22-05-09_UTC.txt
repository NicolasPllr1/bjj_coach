We had the pleasure of hosting this super talented young athlete today - Cole Abate @coleabatejj of AOJ. He was in town visiting family and stopped by. This young man has tremendous skills, great work ethic and a deep passion for the sport - all the ingredients required for greatness! He impressed everyone with his game today! With young athletes like these the future of Jiu jitsu looks very bright indeed!
