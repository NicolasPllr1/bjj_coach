Congratulations to my good friend Bernardo Faria for being inducted into the IBJJF Hall of Fame this weekend during the World Championships in California. Bernardo was one of the finest jiu jitsu athletes of his generation and has since gone on to become a cofounder of @bjj.fanatics the jiu jitsu instructional video that I work for. Mr Faria has done what very few have succeeded in doing - in the splintered and tribal world of jiu jitsu he gained near universal respect and trust and unified every corner of jiu jitsu into his company to revolutionize learning in the internet Information Age. Developing athletes now can get the cutting edge technique from the best athletes from every camp and school. I believe that the next few generations of athletes will far surpass the level of current athletes due to this incredible information advantage over previous generations. As an athlete Mr Faria represented himself and his school with great distinction, but now he represents all of jiu jitsu in bringing together all the best players and coaches to benefit the sport as a whole. Here I am with Mr Faria and his co founder, Michael Zenga after watching @bjj.fanatics athlete @nicholasmeregali win the gold medal in the Open Weight Division - a great moment for all of us. Congratulations Bernardo - itâ€™s been a huge honor ðŸ˜œðŸ˜œ to work with you. Thank you for helping my students so much and so many other great athletes and coaches with your work!
