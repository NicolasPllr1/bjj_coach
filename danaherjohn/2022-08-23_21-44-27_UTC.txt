If you can get around an arm - you’re in control: Every time you start to engage you’re in front of your opponents arms - if you can slip around or over them - there is nothing between you and your opponents back - and that’s always the best place to be! See your opponents arms for they are - the major barrier between you and your opponents back. If you can cultivate the art of beating the arms - it won’t be king until you’re beating opponents!
