The basis of an opponents defense will always be his STANCE. It stands to reason therefore, that if you want to be successful with your attacks, BEGIN BY ATTACKING AND BREAKING HIS STANCE and only then go into the attack itself. Attacking a fortified defensive defensive position is dangerous and costly work - attacking a position whose defensive walls have been broken down is easy. Begin every attack with an attack on the opponents stance and your Jiu jitsu will go to a higher level.
