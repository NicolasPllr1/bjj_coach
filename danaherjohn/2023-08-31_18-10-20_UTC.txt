Thank you! Thanks so much to all the folks who came to support Marcelo Garcia last night at Xtreme Couture in Las Vegas prior to IBJJF World Masters. Over eighty people attended and will give Mr Garcia great boost as he recovers from cancer surgery over the next six months. Thank you all so much. It was a pleasure working with @gordonlovesjiujitsu @nicholasmeregali and @helenajiujitsugirl and watching them do such an outstanding job teaching. It was an honor to be part of such a great cause and for such a great man. Tomorrow Nicholas and Helena compete in what has become one of the biggest events of the year - there are also some really great grappling super matches in addition to the main event Grand Prix - keep your eyes on this one!
