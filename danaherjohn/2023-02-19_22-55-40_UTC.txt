It all starts with grip: Gripping is the first interaction you have with your opponent in every single match, sparring round and indeed, every single exchange from your first day in jiu jitsu until your last. It is the single most common action in the sport and yet shockingly, the least talked about, discussed and taught. How you grip determines how you act. The quality of your opponents grip gives you an immediate read as to what skill level he possesses. The better you get, the more you will identify GRIPPING as the basis of victory. If you can dominate the grips you won’t dominate any other aspect of the match; if you can, you will have the initiative in every exchange between the two of you. Don’t just grab opponents - have an idea of what you want to accomplish first and then grip second, in accordance with that idea. Once you grip - move into the plan - don’t grip and stop - even the best grips won’t last long, so grip and move. Having a strong grip is a good thing, but not nearly so important as grip placement and the ability to go from one grip to another in rapid succession. It may not be the glamorous skill in Jiu jitsu - that lack of glamor is why no one cares to teach it or learn it - but nothing surpasses it in importance
