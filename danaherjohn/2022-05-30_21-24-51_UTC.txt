Can you remember the first submission you ever successfully applied in sparring? One of the first great memories in your jiu jitsu life is the first time you successfully applied a submission hold on a sparring partner. Submissions are among the more difficult moves of the sport. A lot of prerequisites have to be satisfied before they happen. Usually we succeed with positional moves like passing guard or getting mounted before we successfully apply a submission - positional movements generally don’t require as many complex movements and controls and so come more naturally to most students. My first successful submission was an utterly atrocious headlock lift and squeeze that overwhelmed my equally inexperienced white belt opponent only because I was bigger and stronger. My first real submission was an arm bar (juji gatame) from guard. When my partner tapped I couldn’t believe it had worked! A real submission applied from underneath! Success breeds success and I went hunting for guard position and arm bar attacks from there every chance I got. Then when I finally landed a successful kimura from guard, I started chasing kimura incessantly. What was your first big submission breakthrough? Did it go on to become your favorite move? (At least for a while). Why do you think it was that move in particular that worked early for you? Was it because your coach heavily emphasized it? Or perhaps because it was well suited to your body type? Or was it just random? Sometimes it’s useful to ask these questions to know yourself better and make assessments as to what you should work on in the future!
