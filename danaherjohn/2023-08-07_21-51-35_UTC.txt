Focus vs myopia: When you start to enter a given move in jiu jitsu, there is a natural tendency to focus everything on the execution of that move. This is not a bad thing - you’ll need mental and physical focus to get it to work against a strongly resisting opponent. However, don’t let your focus degenerate into myopia where you can’t see past the the move you’re trying to execute. Remember always that against skilled resistance you’ll most likely need a follow up move or two. So even as your focused on that initial attack, keep a little reserve for a potential follow up just in case the first move doesn’t get completed.
