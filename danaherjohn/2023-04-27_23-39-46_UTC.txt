Getting work done: Itâ€™s always great seeing two of my favorite people in Jiu jitsu - the great Bernardo Faria - co founder of @bjj.fanatics and one of the best competitors of his generation - and Brian Glick - one of my original students stretching back to the beginnings of my career. We talked today about age and jiu jitsu, the relationship between training and technique development in the gi versus no gi and filmed the AGELESS JIU JITSU video that sparked the conversation. Back at it again tomorrow!!
