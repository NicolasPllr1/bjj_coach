Ashi waza!! There’s nothing like a foot sweep to show the true nature of Jiu jitsu. Of all the techniques in Jiu jitsu, judo and wrestling, it’s hard to beat foot sweeps for the best expression of maximum efficiency and best results for effort expended. That feeling of catching an opponent mid step on a weightless leg and letting gravity do the work for you is the best feeling in the sport. Most takedowns are grueling affairs with a lot of effort and risk involved. Foot sweeps minimize risk and maximize reward like nothing else. They can be a little frustrating initially as there is some timing skill involved, but like all good things - the potential rewards more than justify the delay in gratification - make them part of your skill set!!
