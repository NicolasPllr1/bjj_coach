A balanced game: Make sure your game is evenly balanced between offense and defense. Of course we all love the idea of offense and wish that we could always be attacking - but the hard reality is that if you’re engaged with tough opponents you’ll be tested every moment and it’ll be the quality of your defense that determines whether you win or lose. So make sure you study deeply in defense to maintain a well balanced game. Athletes whose game has an offensive bias do well at lower levels when their offense overwhelms opponents, but struggle as they rise and have to match better opponents where they are attacked as much as they attack. Stay balanced in your training time between defense and offense.
