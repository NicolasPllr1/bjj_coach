The best of the best: ADCC 2022 is coming up next week. The main event features the great Andre Galvao vs Gordon Ryan in a super fight that could well be described as the bout to determine who is the greatest ADCC athlete of all time. Mr Galvao has amassed a record that far surpasses any other ADCC athlete with regards superfight success. He is one of a handful of athletes who have achieved double gold in ADCC. Gordon Ryan entered ADCC in 2017 with the most successful debut in history and then hit double gold in only his second ADCC event as well as becoming one of a tiny number of athletes who have won gold in different weight divisions. They are both at the top of the game, they have both taken hard fought but dominant forty minute wins over the other great figure of this era, Felipe Pena. Each has a very different style and approach to Jiu jitsu. Mr Galvao is the greatest no gi TACTICIAN of all time, Gordon Ryan is the greatest no gi TECHNICIAN of all time. The history of jiu jitsu shows very clearly that tacticians often defeat technicians and technicians often defeat tacticians - it goes both ways - they can both beat each other, but in very different ways - thatâ€™s what makes this such a compelling match up. Training has been harsh for both men. Mr Ryan had to peak for three different events in this camp, first a super fight with Pedro Marino, then Felipe Pena and now an ADCC where he will do both his weight division AND the super fight - the first man in history to attempt this. No mortal knows what will happen, but one thing we do know is that whoever wins achieves grappling immortality.
