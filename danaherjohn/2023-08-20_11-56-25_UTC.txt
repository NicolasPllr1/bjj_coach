Daniel Manasoiu wins ADCC Open in Vancouver: Big Dan @jiujitsugiant continued his impressive run at the ADCC Open events of 2023 winning his eighth gold medal with another double gold in heavyweight and absolute divisions with almost all wins via submission.  Itâ€™s great to see these events giving young athletes the chance to develop experience in the ADCC rule set in preparation for the real thing at ADCC trials coming up over the next few months. Well done Dan!!
