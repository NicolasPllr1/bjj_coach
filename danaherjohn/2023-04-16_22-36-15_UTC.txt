Fixating on where you want to be is half the battle: To a person who doesn’t know where they want to be jiu jitsu is a confusing mess. To a person who knows where they want to be but lacks the technical skill to get there, Jiu jitsu is a frustrating mess. Take heart however, just the act of mentally fixating on your positional goals will get you to them more often than you’d think. In a match there are myriad opportunities made available by the chaos of action that enable the athlete who keeps laser like focus on goals to identify opportunities and act on them immediately. As they say, a good plan enacted immediately is better than a great plan enacted later. So too in jiu jitsu. A decent move performed now is better than a mechanically perfect move performed too late. Just having that mental focus of where you want to be at all times will enable you overcome some shortcomings in technique and use opportunity as the path to the goal rather than mechanical perfection. Know where you want to be at all times and when at any time an opportunity presents itself - you’ll be ready to get to your positional goals
