Your power is in your hips and legs: We humans are physically a rather feeble bunch compared with the other major mammals on this planet. One thing we do have going for us however, is the power of the hips. Your hips and legs are by far the strongest way to generate power and endurance that we have available - so itâ€™s up to you to ensure that you make them the focus of your entire game. See you arms as just a means of connecting yourself to an opponent - but the engine room  of the body is downstairs in the hips and legs. Let this simple truth guide all your training, whether it be jiu jitsu or your strength and endurance training.
