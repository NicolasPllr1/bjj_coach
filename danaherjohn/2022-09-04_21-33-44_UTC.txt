Position AND submission: In most cases we distinguish between positional moves and submission moves. Indeed, the old cliche does more than separate them - it puts a sequence between them - position comes BEFORE submission. There are many moves however, that are both submission AND positional moves. Many moves such as juji gatame armbars, kata gatame strangles, variations of triangle strangles, many versions of ashi ashi garami etc that can be used both pin or sweep and opponent and to finish them. These moves are of extraordinary value, since they close the usual gap between position and submission and allow you to work for both at the same time. Make sure you work and train both aspects of the move so that you can derive maximum value from them. Start with the classic arm bar juji gatame. Instead of just trying to extend the arm, challenge yourself to see how long you can pin someone down without extending their arm. Start to see it for what it is - both a pin and a submission. This will make you work the move to its full potential. You’ll need this as you grapple better and better opponents who aren’t easy to submit - you’ll have an extra element to these moves that’ll keep you ahead of the opposition!
