Whatever your weight is - make sure your opponent feels every ounce of it: We typically think of weight and top pressure as the methodology of bigger athletes, but in truth, everyone, even the lightest, should do their best to use their bodyweight constructively to tire and immobilize opponents. The most important elements in your success or failure in this regard will be the robustness of your connection to the opponent, the placement/positioning of your body relative to your opponent and the duration of the pressure you create. This means you’ll need a solid grip, your weight positioned on a part of your opponent’s body that is ill suited to carry bodyweight (for example, his head) and riding skill to stay there long enough to cause fatigue. If you can get these elements in place you’ll make an opponent regret being underneath you regardless of your size and weight!
