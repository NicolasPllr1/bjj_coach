It start with your hands: Jiu jitsu is all about EVER INCREASINGLY CLOSE CONTACT INTO EVER INCREASINGLY MORE ADVANTAGEOUS POSITIONS. But that close contact has to start somewhere - and in the majority of cases that will be with the HANDS. get used to coming at the start of each engagement with hands ready for action. Work to get your hands into grips and positions from which all the subsequent movements you require can follow naturally. Condition your hands for hard gripping strength and endurance - I always recommend rope climbing above all other methods - but remember always that efficiency of grip always counts for more than strength of grip.
