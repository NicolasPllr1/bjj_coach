Happy 4th of July! I always loved the American holiday of 4th of July. Iâ€™ve seen it celebrated in many American cities - especially my long time home in New York City where they always put on a great show on the river. This was my first time in Austin Texas and they out in quite a show! Austin looks great by night and with fireworks blazing even better! Where ever you are I hope you had a great day!
