Dilemmas: Whenever you can - attack in pairs of moves rather than a single move. If possible, choose a pair that go in opposite directions so that as opponent defends one he walks into the other. For example, when getting past an opponents defensive arms you can attack inside the arms towards the centerline or outside the arms at an angle towards the back - the more an opponent invests in defending one, the more vulnerable he becomes to the other. Play these two off against each other and youâ€™ll find it much easier to get past resistance. This foundational principle is at the heart of all good jiu jitsu.
