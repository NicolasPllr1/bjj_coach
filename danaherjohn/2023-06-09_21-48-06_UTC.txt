Lever and fulcrum: Many of the major moves of this game involve using your body and your opponent’s body as lever and fulcrum. This is one of the major means by which smaller/weaker people can overcome and defeat bigger/stronger people. Just make sure you use lever and fulcrum to maximum advantage. Adjusting the position and height of the fulcrum and always using the end of the lever can mean big improvements to the force you can generate. Make a habit of adjusting lever and fulcrum PRIOR to applying force - it will shock you how much of a difference it can make to moves you’ve been using for a long time.
