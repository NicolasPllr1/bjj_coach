Learn new material all the time - but don’t forget to maintain your old strengths: There nothing more fun than learning new skills  and some time soon the effort spent learning those new skills will pay off for you but understand that time devoted to new skills inevitably means less time working on your old skills and therefore a slight drop in performance. Don’t worry too much about this. Remember that it’s MUCH easier to relearn old skills than it is to learn new skills - so if your old moves decline a little as you seek new directions, a little time spent with them will soon have them back into top form.
