Home: In early January I will go home to see my Mother in Australia. It’s been a very long time. Australia had very strict Covid laws that prevented my usual family visits for a long time, then I had to get started with a new team in a new location and get them ready for the ADCC World Championships. In that time I’ve been a good coach - but a bad son. Now it’s time to go and see Mom (in New Zealand and Australia we say “Mum” in the British fashion rather than the American “Mom”). I will probably fly down early to mid January and spend a week or two there. I always love that journey and seeing my dear Mum and family - it’s a long journey but a good one!I’m also looking forward to seeing more of the incredible growth of Jiu Jitsu in Australia and New Zealand that has gotten them such great results in international competition in recent years! See you soon Mum!
