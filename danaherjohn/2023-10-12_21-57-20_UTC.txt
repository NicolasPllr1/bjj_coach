Smooth: The single biggest differentiator between skilled and unskilled athletes on the mat is the degree of effect in the application of moves versus the amount of effort expended to get that effect. Great athletes have a way of getting more done with less. Their game has an effortless look to it that stands out in a sea of lesser athletes who struggle mightily to gain little. When you drill seek to get the maximum effect with the least effort. That doesn’t mean being a limp rag doll. Sometimes the minimum effort required is still quite considerable - it just means being as economical as circumstances allow - and very often that allow you to be MUCH more economical than most believe. It all starts with mindset. Smooth it out. Aspire to economical grace - in time this demeanor will spread from your drilling to your sparring - and that’s when real progress starts.
