Giving your best: We tend to think “giving your best effort” in Jiu jitsu means giving your best PHYSICAL effort. Indeed, we usually equate the degree to which we are physically spent at the end of the workout as the basis of the value of the workout. There certainly is virtue in regular hard physical work, but don’t think it ends there. As the old saying goes, the hardest work is hard thinking. After your physical work you must do your mental work. Study is work. Indeed it is work just as important as your physical work on the mats. You must engage in study of yourself, techniques and great athletes. Mental study reveals the lessons of todays physical work and sets the agenda for tomorrow’s physical work. Hard physical work without study is like a strong but blind man trying to work on a task, only study gives your physical work the vision required to get efficiently to your goals
