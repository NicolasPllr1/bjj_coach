Distance: Control of distance is a crucial concept in all combat sports and jiu jitsu is no exception. There will be times where you can make effective grips on an opponent, but they cannot make effective grips on you. These are the moments when you want to make distance work in your favor. Maintain a distance where you can make effective grips but your opponent can’t and you’ll have a handy initial advantage that will create momentum in your favor at the onset of an engagement. While that certainly doesn’t guarantee a win, if you can do this consistently you’ll stack the odd well in your favor, and in this game, that’s the best we can ever do.
