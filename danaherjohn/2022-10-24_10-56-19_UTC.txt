Heading back: Early morning start back to Austin after EBI 20 Open Weight in El Paso Tx. It was great seeing the return of the old EBI grappling format last night. Unfortunately Giancarlo Bodoni badly tore a rib in the opening minute of his first match. He went on to win in over time but could not continue into the next round as even breathing was very difficult. Any time breathing is painful with rib injuries it’s prudent to avoid further damage - especially in an open weight event where all your opponents are much larger than you. Luke Griffith had a fine win in his first match via mounted smother. In his second match he had a great tussle with Nicky Rod and attacked well with a heel hook, Nicky Rod came back with excellent positional control passing into mount. They went to over time and Nicky Rod won with a very well applied transition to arm lock from back control. Nicky Rod went on to win the event in fine fashion - showing that he is much more than a wrestler with fine array of submissions. Now it’s back to Austin for a full day of teaching! Hope you all enjoyed the show!
