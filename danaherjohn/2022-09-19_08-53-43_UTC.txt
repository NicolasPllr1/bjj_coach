Victory in Las Vegas!! ADCC 2022 was the greatest show in grappling history. The best of the best came and out in a show that will never be forgotten. Gordon Ryan showed why they call him the King and stands atop the grappling world. He became the first person ever to win three world titles in three different weight categories and also the first person ever to compete and win in both weight category and superfight. He beat the greatest ADCC grappler of all time, the great Andre Galvao in a passing of the torch in greatness. Giancarlo Bodoni shocked the world to win gold in the hyper competitive 88kg category in his ADCC debut - a truly incredible accomplishment. Nicholas Meregali won silver and Bronze medals in his ADCC debut after only around six months of no gi training. A truly incredible accomplishment in a world where everyone specializes in one of the other. Itâ€™s been a crazy day - I have to run now - I will write more soon to fill you in one details. I want to thank the ADCC organization and in particular @mojassim80 who worked tirelessly for a two years and massive personal expense to make this show what it was. I also want to thank all my students who elevated the performance of our competitors to a new level. I hope you all enjoyed the show!!!
