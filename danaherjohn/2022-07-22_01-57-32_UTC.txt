Rites of passage: Almost all my adult life I lived in NYC so I never bought a car. I always used the subway, trains and cabs to get around. I didn’t even have a driver’s license, forget about a car. Now I’ve moved to Texas so I finally had to learn to drive and buy a car - of course when I finally decide to buy a car the American car market goes into total chaos and prices of cars and gasoline skyrocket 😂😂😂 All these years my friends would always tell me horror stories of the daily and weekly expenses of their vehicles. In NYC it was smashed windows, paint scratched off by people parking clumsily next to them, broken indicator lights, burst tires and damaged rims from potholes and of course flat tires. I always thought to myself as I heard their stories “thank god I don’t have these problems!” Well, now I finally do! 😂😂 I got to work teaching today and saw a giant screw sticking out of my rear tire! 😂😂😂 I guess I’m finally living the real American experience! 😂😂😂 Off to the tire shop tomorrow to get it plugged or maybe even replaced 🤦‍♂️😂🤦‍♂️Now  I know what you’ll have been going through all these years! 😂😂 I enjoy driving but it’s definitely a perk with problems!
