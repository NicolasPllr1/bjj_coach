Pajama party: Filming my latest video in Boston with the inestimable Brian Glick @bzglick my long suffering student from NYC days and a true jiu jitsu treasure. We are filming video on Jiu jitsu for older and less athletic players - I feel like this is one thing I am truly qualified to teach because Iâ€™m an old cripple! ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ Nothing makes me happier as a coach than seeing an older or less athletic student taking on a much younger or athletically gifted opponent in the dojo and giving him hell - thatâ€™s when you really see the magic of jiu jitsu!
