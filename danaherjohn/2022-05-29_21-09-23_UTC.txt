Once you take someone off the mat - you own them: The second an opponent takes you up and you lose contact with the mat and them - you are no no longer in control of events - they are. Make a habit of digging yourself in underneath an opponents center of gravity and you’ll find that it confers great advantage and gives you an open door to your attacks. The only thing that gives us control over our movement and position is contact with the floor and the opponent - once you lose those, you lose the game of control until you regain them. Make lifting and elevation a big part of your game and you’ll create an expressway to many of your favorite attacks that opponents will have a very hard time dealing with.
