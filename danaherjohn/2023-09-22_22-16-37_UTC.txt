All reversals and sweeps score the same: In most grappling sports there are rewards for amplitude when performing takedowns - the bigger the takedown - the more you score. In Jiu jitsu takedowns and guard sweeps, there is no reward for amplitude - they all score the same two points regardless of their form. Youâ€™re rewarded only for the fact that you went from bottom position to top position. So even a scrappy, ugly, stop-start reversal will score the same as a beautiful classical sweep. Keep this in mind at all times, because often there will be opportunities to simply come up from bottom and tackle an opponent or go behind them, or even just rush them down after a failed initial sweep attempt. Again, there only has to be a reversal of top and bottom position to get a score - so anything that does that is a win no matter what it looks like.
