Climbing the rope: When you go to climb a rope you don’t just magically spring up to the top of the rope - you get your grips and climb step by step to your goal at the top. So too, in grappling. You generally start at the extremities of the body - the hands or head if you are standing or bottom position and the feet if you are in top position, and then you climb progressively to the center of the body, gaining ever increasing control as you get closer to the hips, spine and head. Don’t start at the destination. Start at the extremities and climb your way there.
