Congratulations to Satoshi Ishii @satoshiishii0141 He just won his MMA fight via elbow TKO in Europe after training with us in Austin Texas. He was both Olympic and All Japan Judo champion and training with him has been a tremendous learning experience. I am always very happy to see the unification of Judo and jiu jitsu as they complement each other so well. Congratulations to Ishii San! He represents extremely well the tremendous work ethic of Japanese athletes and gives everything in daily training - it is great to see his hard work rewarded with victory ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µ
