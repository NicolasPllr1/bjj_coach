Base: Whenever you are in standing position or top position it is generally demanded of you to keep a solid base of support that enables you to keep standing or top position as long as you desire it. Intuitively it feels like the best way to keep a strong base of support is to WIDEN your base as much as possible. This would be true if you were alone and static - but in a match you aren’t - you are constantly moving in response to an opponent. As such width of base is only a part of the story. What you really want is a DYNAMIC BASE. It will be your ability to maintain base through MOVEMENT that makes you successful against a resisting opponent. It’s not so much the stationary width of of your base as your ability to step and post to a new base of support in response to second by second changes as the match unfolds. Very often this means taking a rather narrow initial stance so that you can pick up a foot easily and move it, rather than a heavy, exaggerated wide stance that makes it difficult to make a reactionary step in response to an opponents movement. Here, Daniel Manasoiu uses a good natural stance to easily pick up a foot and move to a new base of support in response to an opponent trying to off balance him at the 2022 ADCC World Championships
