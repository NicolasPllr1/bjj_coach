Attack his stance first - everything else second: The strength of an opponents defense is directly proportional to the strength/integrity of his stance. The better the stance, the stronger his defense. Your goal then, is to break his stance prior to attacking. Understand that a good opponent will recover quickly whenever his stance is compromised, so once you’ve broken it - don’t procrastinate - attack! Push and pull are always the basis of attacking an opponents stance - all the major methods fall into those two categories - add the notion of tripping an opponent while pushing and pulling and you will be able to disrupt even a very strong stance. Make it your priority every time you’re about to attack and those attacks of yours will be much more successful!
