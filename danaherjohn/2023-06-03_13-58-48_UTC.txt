Double World Champion!! Outstanding teenage phenom Helena Crevar @helenajiujitsugirl won double gold at the IBJJF World Championships in California yesterday. She won both her weight division and absolute division in the teenage blue belt category. She won all matches via submission with a heavy emphasis of triangles and arm bars in an excellent display of her attacking style. When Nicholas Meregali was preparing for his WNO gi match we began morning gi classes balanced with afternoon no gi. After the match Helena continued her gi training with just a single training partner every day as the rest of the class reverted back to no gi training for upcoming matches. She showed excellent focus and discipline throughout that preparation and successfully applied many of the moves and tactics she worked in her preparation. Well done Helena!!
