Getting ready: This Sunday night in Houston Texas, Gordon Ryan will take in the formidable Brazilian world champion grappler Patrick Gaudio at the WNO Grappling event on @flograppling These two titans met before in an epic match at the IBJJF No Gi World Championships - it was a very tightly contested affair - Mr Guadio fought brilliantly that day and with limited time left on the clock he was ahead on points and seemingly heading towards a dramatic victory - with less than a minute left, Gordon Ryan turned it around and scored just enough in the closing seconds to take a very narrow win! Now the two will meet again, this time in a very different rule set and a longer match. Both athletes have changed a lot since their last meeting so there is definitely an element of the unknown going into this. Mr Ryan is coming back after some serious relapses with his stomach issues but has trained well in preparation for what should be a great rematch. Mr Guadio is a powerfully built athlete with legendary strength and explosiveness- he used that very well in the last match to explode up from bottom position and score on Mr Ryan - something very few of his opponents have been able to do. There are many other great great matches on that night also - it feature two mini tournaments at 170 and 155 pounds featuring some of the best competitors in the world - this should be a great show!
