Combining two moves into one: One well applied jiu jitsu can be a real threat - when two moves are combined into one the threat can become overwhelming. Arguably the best move when it comes to co-joining moves is the triangle. Once you lock a triangle you immediately attack with simultaneous kimura, juji gatame arm bar, ude gatame straight arm bar, wrist locks - all kinds of madness. Defense becomes far more difficult than usual because of the restrictions created by the triangle and the fact that you’re under threat of a strangle the whole time you’re struggling to defend yourself. Jiu jitsu has many such opportunities to turn two moves into one - make sure you look to incorporate them into your game! Here teenage blue belt phenom @helenajiujitsugirl Helena shows excellent form in combining the effects of triangle and arm bar together to get another win
