Getting the crew back together! Iâ€™m filming in Boston this week with @placisantos @bzglick @bnzaiii on the final installment of the AGELESS JIU JITSU series for Jiu jitsu athletes who feel they lack athleticism due to age or perhaps a lack of athletic background or injury - this one features bottom position in the gi. After a long day of filming Iâ€™m definitely not feeling ageless ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜œðŸ˜‚ Now we will get some dinner and get ready for more filming tomorrow ðŸ˜œ
