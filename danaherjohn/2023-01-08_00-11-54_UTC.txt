Favorite moves: All great athletes have their signature moves. These form the basis of their attacking game. Once you develop one solid attacking move it will force opponents to react to it in predictable ways. This will enable you to develop follow up moves that counter your opponent’s counters to that original move. Thus does the original move function like the trunk of a tree and from that trunk grows multiple branches and from them more branches until a complete tree grows and emerges. In this way a few favorite moves can create great growth across your entire game. I usually discourage athletes from trying to FORCE a favorite move. It will usually come to you naturally and organically as a response to your body type and personality and coaching lineage. Once you have a few favorites they will form the bedrock of your offense. Add appropriate supplements to those moves in response to opponent’s resistance and soon you’ll have a complete offensive game that fits you as naturally as your favorite clothes
