Victory in Las Vegas! New Wave Jiu jitsu sent a team of talented juniors to the @ufcfightpass event UFC Fight Pass Invitational where they competed in four vs four team events under the leadership of Anthony Pettis. @olivertaza @jiujitsugiant @giancarlobodoni @cpapadelos performed very well under the lights Big Dan got two submissions in the first round, Giancarlo Bodoni had a dominant showing against the very talented 10th planet athlete PJ Barch and Oliver Taza secured victory in the final round with a fine submission over the very talented ADCC trials winner Jay Rodriguez from B Team and then showed a strong positional game against the great Penn State wrestler Bo Nickal with a reversal and several guard passes to win a close decision victory for his team. Great stuff from the youngsters in Vegas!!
