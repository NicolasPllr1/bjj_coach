Sad news: Gordon Ryan will have to pull out of the WNO grappling super fight with Felipe Pena scheduled for this weekend in Costa Mesa. Mr Ryan was afflicted with severe stomach issues that resulted in a severe and quick weight loss/dehydration along with severe nausea and associated symptoms. He tried hard to shrug it off and bulldoze through it but to no avail. Even very mild workouts left him totally exhausted and physically debilitated. It was a tough call as both athletes had invested a lot in preparation for this match and expectations were high, but I believe it is the correct call. This match deserves both athletes in peak physical condition. The good news is that the event still has amazing matches scheduled for the fans. The great JT Torres returns to competition and Giancarlo Bodoni takes on world champion Pedro Merinho for the 205 point world title. The main event has been switched to Felipe Pena vs Nick Rodriguez. This should be a great match. These two had an epic match at ADCC with a Nicky Rod taking a closely fought victory via guard pass. This time however itâ€™s a totally different rule set and thirty minutes long. Both are very physically imposing but in very different ways - one is fast and explosive, the other isometric Pythonesque strength. This should be a great match!! Keep tuned to @flograppling for updates for schedule, pre-match interviews etc
