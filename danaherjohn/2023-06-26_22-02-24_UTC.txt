Friends and mentors: Mentors can have a powerful influence on your development in Jiu jitsu. One of my most important mentors when I began Jiu jitsu was IBJJF world jiu jitsu champion, ADCC champion and UFC champion - the inestimable Matt Serra @mattserrabjj He was a dynamo in the gym - one of the very few Americans of that era who could prove a real match for the best in the world. He inspired me and everyone else in that room to get better. Last night he and old friends Din Thomas and John Rallo stopped by for dinner. Matt is in town to do the Joe Rogan @joerogan podcast! Let me tell you something - Joe Rogan is a very talented and well trained comedian, but Matt Serra is the best natural comedian I ever met in my life! Between the two of them this is going to be an instant classic of humor and jiu jitsu! I can’t wait to see this one! Anyway, it was great seeing my old buddies from the pre-basement days once again! Thank you always Matt for being such a good jiu jitsu influence on all of us and taking everyone’s expectations for what they could achieve to a higher level.
