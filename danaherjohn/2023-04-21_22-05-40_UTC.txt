This a sport where seemingly insignificant shifts of position of a hand, a foot, your hips or head, can mean the difference between a move working or not moving, and hence, between victory and defeat. Better to study a few moves deeply then, rather than many moves in a shallow fashion. You will be rewarded for the DEPTH of your knowledge more so than the BREADTH of your knowledge. Once you discover which moves have potential for you - study deeply and relentlessly. There is no end to improvement - even for moves you’ve been performing for years. There’s always something more than can potentially improve your performance. You can skimp on many things in life but study and practice is not one of them.
