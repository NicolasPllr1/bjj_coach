am very happy to announce the release today of my latest instructional video: AGELESS JIU JITSU: WINNING WHEN YOU’RE OLDER OR LESS ATHLETIC: TOP GAME: NO GI. In this video I look at how players who feel they are somewhat athletically compromised by age or injury or just a lack of athletic background before beginning Jiu jitsu can develop an effective no gi top game that enables them to be highly competitive against younger and more athletic opponents. Athletic ability is not delved out equally and doesn’t last forever so it’s important to understand that if the body is somehow lacking, your mind must make up for that lack with sound tactics and technique selection. There are ways to approach the game that require less speed, flexibility and muscular endurance that are nonetheless highly effective even at the highest levels; and by focusing on this aspects you can extend your effectiveness further than many believe is possible. All of the techniques selected require little to no athleticism and are encased in a game plan designed to inhibit movement and slow a younger and more athletic opponent down to a pace and positions where control is possible and knowledge rather than speed or explosiveness become the deciding factor. If this sounds like something your interested in, check it out at @bjj.fanatics Link in my story and bio
