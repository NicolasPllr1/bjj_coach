Quick movements get you TO a good position, but it will be isometric endurance/tension and locking yourself into the geometry of your opponents body that will KEEP you there. The value of getting to a good position is lost if you can’t maintain it. The skills of maintaining a position are never going to make a highlight reel but they are among the most important for winning matches. Your ability to gain a good position is only as useful as your ability to keep it long enough to exert pressure and progress into even better positions or submission holds. Focus upon shutting down your opponent’s ability to move in the ways that might enable him to escape. Every escape begins with a first step - so attack that first step with your body positioning and tension and if you do your job well, you won’t have to worry about the subsequent steps.
