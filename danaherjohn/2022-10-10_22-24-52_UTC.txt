A short chat with Lex Fridman: My friend Lex Fridman and I recently did another podcast - it got completely out of hand and went a marathon four and a half hours! We talked mostly about ADCC 2022 and the stellar performances of Gordon Ryan, Giancarlo Bodoni, Nicholas Meregali and the Ruotolo twins. After that things got crazy as people offered their own questions which immediately went Straight to animal fights - grizzly bear vs Lion! ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ It was a fun rambling chat and Alex always has a way of making things fun and interesting - hope you enjoy it!
