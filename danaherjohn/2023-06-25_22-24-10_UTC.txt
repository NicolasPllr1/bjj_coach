Step by step: Jiu Jitsu is a game of incremental progressions towards a goal. The goal is always submission, but to get there you’ll need to to pass a chain of events and steps that can stretch out very long at times. It’ll start with initial contact and grip and progress through ever increasing body contact and in most cases increasingly dominant positions characterized by your ability to either get behind your opponent or get past his legs into upper body pins. As you spar always think in terms of the next steps. You know the goal - what’s the next step? What do you have to do to complete that step? If you complete that step what’s the next step after that? This is the mindset you’ll need to work with at all times. The long distance vision is always clear and simple - it’s the myopic vision of the next step that’ll be less clear to you in the heat of sparring - but work within this pattern every day and soon enough things will become clear to you
