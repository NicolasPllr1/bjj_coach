Your best move is only as good as your ability to get yourself in a position to apply it: When most people think of their best move they think in terms of how good they are at EXECUTING the move. That certainly is in important, but that wonâ€™t help you at all if you can never get to the starting position for the move. In practice is is at least as important to be able to steer the action towards your favorite move. START your study with execution - but make sure you COMPLETE it with set ups and ability to maneuver your opponent INTO the move
