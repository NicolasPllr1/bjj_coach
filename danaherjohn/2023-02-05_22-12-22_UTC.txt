Start at the extremities and work to the core: The best control of the human body is at the hips and head - if you control both of those then you truly control your opponent. The problem is that the head and hips are difficult to get a hold of. This means that the typical pattern of Jiu jitsu is to initiate contact at the extremities - the feet and hands - and work methodically up the limbs to the hips or head. Itâ€™s rather like climbing a tree or a rope - you have to climb to get to your goal. Get used to this type of action - it will form the basis of every engagement you make in the sport
