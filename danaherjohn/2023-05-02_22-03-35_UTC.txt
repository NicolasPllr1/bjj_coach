Re-learning is much easier than learning: I am often told by students that they fear learning new moves because when they do their performance level falls with their old moves. There is some truth to this. Whenever you focus on something new, it is always to the detriment of something old. You have only so much of an attention span and once you start paying attention to new techniques it’s normal to feel yourself slipping backwards in the performance of your old moves. Don’t worry - it’s much easier to relearn a move then to learn it from scratch. If you aren’t quite as sharp with an old move that you used to favor because you’ve been focusing on new material, it doesn’t take long to hone your skills back into shape. Once learned, knowledge is easily recalled. Keep pushing boundaries with your skill set and have faith that you can always bring old skills back to top level with a little renewed focus any time you need them back
