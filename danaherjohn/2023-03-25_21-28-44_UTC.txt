Victory in Florida! Outstanding New Wave athlete Helena Crevar @helenajiujitsugirl won double gold today at the IBJJF Pan Ams in juvenile blue belt division - both weight division and absolute. Here she is with her proud parents who do so much to support her training and competition preparation. The teenage phenom won every match by submission with not a single point being scored on her in a blistering display of positional pressure and submission skill. In addition, BJJ icon Nicholas Meregali advanced to tomorrow’s open weight finals with a devastating display of his submission skills - winning every match by strangle or suffocation from mount or rear mount. Tomorrow he will contest his weight division and the absolute final! It’s been great watching the matches today - so many talented athletes in all weight divisions, belt levels and age brackets! Keep your eyes on events tomorrow!!
