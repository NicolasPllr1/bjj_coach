Thailand: We are counting down to the big @onechampionship event here in Thailand. It will be fought in legendary Lumpinee Stadium Bangkok, one of the great homes of Muay Thai and the headline bout will feature one of my absolute favorite current Muay Thai fighters, the outstanding Superlek Kiatmuu9, truly one of the technically proficient and exciting strikers in the world today. As such, all the bouts, including the MMA bouts will be fought in a ring rather than a cage. While I believe that a cage is much better suited to the nature of MMA fighting than a ring, it’s very much understandable why in Lumpinee they went with traditional ring, especially when a boxer of Superlek’s stature is the main event in front of Thai audience. A ring brings some unpredictable chaos into MMA bouts when you get close to the ropes and corners, this can be good and bad. Undeniably some of the greatest MMA bouts of all time have been fought in rings - think of all the classic Pride matches - so this will be a very interesting show for this alone. Most of all, it’s an honor to be part of a show in Lumpinee, which stands in the history of Muay Thai as Madison Square Garden does in the history of boxing. Now it’s back to training at the local Muay Thai gym and their ring!
