Brothers and sisters: At the recent Dallas ADCC Open there was a truly outstanding family performance - Luke and Hannah Griffith - brother and sister from South Africa won first place gold - Luke went the extra distance and won double gold by taking the Absolute division as well as his own weight category. @luke_griffithjj  @hxnnah_jade Iâ€™m always impressed by athletes who make big changes and sacrifices in their lives to get to the dreams. Traveling all the way from Africa to Austin Texas to train certainly is a good example of this! Iâ€™m happy to see the global expansion of Jiu jitsu. Brazil, America and Europe are the powerhouses but itâ€™s great to see countries like Australia, Canada and England develop quickly as well - now you can add South Africa to that list of countries with emerging stars! Congratulations Luke and Hannah ðŸ‡¿ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡¿ðŸ‡¦
