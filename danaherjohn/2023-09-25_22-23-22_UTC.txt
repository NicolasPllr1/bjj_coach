Today we had the honor of working alongside one of the greatest athletes in the history of the sport - the great  Rodolfo Viera @rodolfovieira89 This man was a truly dominant force in both gi and no gi Jiu jitsu - winning both ADCC gold and multiple times IBJJF World Championships. It wasn’t just his record that made him a legend, it was the way he won that captured everyone’s attention - he was a peerless pressure fighter who could crush any guard and then work through his inescapable pins to submission. Now his primary focus is MMA but he kindly worked with the squad today in grappling and showed everyone he still has his skills! In addition to being a great athlete, he is also a real gentleman - it’s a true honor to have him here for a week
