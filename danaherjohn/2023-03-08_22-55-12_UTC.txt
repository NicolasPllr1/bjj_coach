Details: This a game where one small adjustment to what you’re doing with a given move can mean the difference between success or failure, between winning and losing. It’s natural then, to obsess over details and try to learn as many as possible in the quest to improve your performance. Remember however, that the human mind has its limits and you won’t be able to remember much under the heat and stress of a competitive match. As such, you must learn to balance the need for detailed knowledge and the reality of our cognitive limitations. Don’t try to learn vast amounts of detail immediately. Rather, pick out two or three key details that have the most positive impact on your performance and focus on those - you can always add additional details later after you’ve thoroughly imprinted the first set of details. Working in this manner is the best way to make quick and positive progress.
