If you can beat the elbow - the back is yours: The back is generally the best place to be in a no gi grappling match. Your opponent knows this and will always put roadblocks between you and his back. One of the most important roadblocks he has are his elbows. As long as he keeps you between his elbows - there is no back exposure. Learning to beat his elbow by going under it, around it or over the top of it is this one of the great skills of the sport. Whenever you’re in front of an opponent keep asking yourself how you can get past his elbow, because if you do, your on the path to victory. Even the most vigilant opponent will at some point get forgetful about the elbow as the barrier to the back. If you move appropriately at that moment you’ll be on his back in a flash - and that may very well be all that’s needed to turn the match in your favor.
