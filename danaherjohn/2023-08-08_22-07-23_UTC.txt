The pin is a means to an end - not the end itself: In grappling pinning is a truly crucial skill. Learning to immobilize opponents is one of the keys to finishing them. Without immobilizing first it’s very hard to consistently enter into submissions. However, don’t stop at immobilization - that’s the path but it’s not the destination - the destination is submission. Make sure when you’re practicing that you always seek to go beyond holding opponents down and go into finishing scenarios. This can be frustrating at first, since the extra movement almost always results in a diminishing of your control and opponents will often slip out of the pin. You have to get past this hurdle and learn to take the risk of extra movement to get the highest reward
