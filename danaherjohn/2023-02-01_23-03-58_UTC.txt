When it comes time to carry the weight of your opponent it is not the strength of your muscles that is most important, but rather, the strength of your STANCE. Whatever degree of functional strength you bring to the scenario you’re engaged in will always be proportional to the strength of your stance. Perfect your stance for all the major scenarios you can expect to find yourself in in a match, learn to move well from one stance to another in accordance with the unfolding action - and you’ll always feel stronger than you look!!
