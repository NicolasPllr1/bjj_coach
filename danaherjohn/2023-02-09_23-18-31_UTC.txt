If you can put their weight on their heels…Sweeping athletic opponents is never easy, but understand this - athleticism is determined by more than genetics - on a second by second basis in a match the single biggest determinant of your athletic potential is your STANCE. It doesn’t matter how athletic you are, if your stance is compromised you will struggle to engage in athletic movement. Nobody is athletic when their weight is placed awkwardly on their heels. Even the most gifted opponents can be made to stumble and fall under those circumstances. Look to set your opponents weight on his heels when you want to knock him backwards and your task will be MUCH easier
