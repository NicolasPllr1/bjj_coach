Big Weekend coming up! The second biggest grappling event of the year is on this weekend with @flograppling WNO Grappling super fight featuring the main event Gordon Ryan vs Felipe Peña. The co main event is also a fascinating match up between Rafael Lavato Jr, one of the greatest grapplers of his generation and a master of jiu jitsu in gi and no gi and also in MMA. He will take on Brazilian superstar Nicholas Meregali in what should a truly great match up. Mr Meregali has only had two no gi matches in his career and had never even trained without a gi until around five months ago, but he has been training hard alongside Mr Ryan and making great progress. He has brilliant overall movement and an attacking style that he transfers over from his stellar gi game and now must try to apply it against an ADCC legend! I’m really looking forward to this match - I’ve seen both train up close and they are both extraordinary athletes with very different styles - watching the clash of those styles will be fascinating!
