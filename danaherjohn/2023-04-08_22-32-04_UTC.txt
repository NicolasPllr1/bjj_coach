The power of strangles: There is no more certain method ending a match or indeed, a fight, than a well applied strangle. It takes time to get the position to apply it but that time will be well rewarded with the highest possible chance of victory if you can get there. Strangles are innately superior to joint locks in so far as their effects are absolutely certain. Make sure you develop at least one strangle from back and one from front that you have absolute faith in - they will surely become your primary weapons
