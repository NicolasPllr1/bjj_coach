Victory in Las Vegas: The UFC ran a great grappling event here in Las Vegas tonight. Gordon Ryan won a tightly contested victory in a dramatic over time against former Team mate Nicky Rod. Mr Ryan showed his attacking prowess in the over time with Mr Rodriguez playing a cagey game to avoid submission and get to over time. In over time both men showed their riding prowess but it was Gordon Ryan who prevailed and won via greater riding time. There was some confusion in the final round as the referee appeared to let the match continue after time had expired as Nicky Rod worked for a stranglehold but the mistake was noted and the win awarded to Gordon Ryan. In the second super fight Dan Manasoiu won via mounted asphyxiation against Ricardo Evangelista. Luke Griffith had a brilliant night, getting to the finals of the absolute tournament after entering on only a days notice. He lost a thriller to Mason Fowler by just a few seconds in triple overtime. Overall a great result for the team. Itâ€™s great to see grappling on @ufcfightpass and great to see the youngsters getting closer to their goals! Hope you all enjoyed the show!!
