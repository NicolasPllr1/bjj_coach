Victory in Dallas! The squad went 3-0 with every match won by submission here in Dallas tonight. South African purple belt phenom Luke Griffith wowed the audience with a spectacular submission via strangulation in the opening minutes of his match against a champion black belt. Keep your eyes on this guy! Brazilian super star Nicholas Meregali made his no gi debut and won with a beautifully applied arm bar in the closing seconds of the match. Gordon Ryan showed the kind of devastating pressure he is renown for to win via chest pressure submission against the very game emerging star Jacob Couch. It was fun taking the road trip from Austin to Dallas and having the event in the Dallas Cowboys home gym! Now itâ€™s time to get back to Austin and get to work for the next performance! Hope you all enjoyed the show!!
