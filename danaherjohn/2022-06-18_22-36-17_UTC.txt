Give yourself a hand: Nature gave you two hands to use in jiu jitsu, but training can give you a third - your head. Your hands can push and pull and opponent and create a base of support AND SO CAN YOUR HEAD - use it well and it’s like having a third hand to gain advantage over tough opponents. Any time you use your head as a substitute for a hand to push, pull or create base - you free up a hand to use to advantage against your opponent. Imagine fighting an opponent with three arms - it would be a nightmare - well, if you use your head creatively you can make yourself a nightmare to your opponents. Develop your neck strength and your head will become a powerful weapon of control and increase by a third your ability to push and pull opponents (the head doesn’t really pull so much as block movement but the practical effect is similar). Next time you feel like your running out of hands to control an opponent - use your head - you’ll be amazed at how effective it is!
