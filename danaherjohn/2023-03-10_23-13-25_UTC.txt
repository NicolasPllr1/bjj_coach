Jiu jitsu, age and athleticism: As in Jiu Jitsu, as in life - you don’t get to work with the body you want, you must work with the body you have. Yes, there are many things you can do to improve the physical capabilities of your body, especially if you have time to work with, but age or a lack of athletic background sometimes mean diminishing physicality that can undermine your ability to perform many of the moves of Jiu jitsu. In these cases it often makes sense to focus on the aspects of Jiu jitsu that are within your current physical reach - at least until you make improvements to your physical abilities. As you progress further in age this becomes an imperative. Indeed, not only must you be more selective in the moves you choose to utilize, you must even become more selective in who you train with and how you train. Every student must learn to adapt their jiu jitsu to their body and their body to Jiu jitsu - as you age or if you have no prior athletic background this will require a greater level of adaptation on your part. Seek to use moves that do not exceed your current mobility level and train with partners who can work around your physical limitations. There are many very good moves that work at the highest level that require very little mobility or flexibility or speed or explosiveness to be effective - focus on these and you’ll be shocked how effective you can be in the mat with younger, fitter and more mobile opponents!
