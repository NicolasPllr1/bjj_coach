Happy Birthday Mum!! Hanging out with my dear Mum who gave me everything she could - born in the USA, raised in New Zealand and coming together in Australia ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸ğŸ‡¦ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡³ğŸ‡¿ Thank you so much for raising us Mum - if i could give my students half of the effort and care you gave us Iâ€™d have a gym full of champions. Thank you also to all the many Australian jiu jitsu students who came to seminars that I taught while here on short notice and at crazy times and locations and showed just how passionate and dedicated they are - itâ€™s been an honor and a pleasure to help where I can.
