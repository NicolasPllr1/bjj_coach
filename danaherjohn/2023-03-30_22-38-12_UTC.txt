I just completed my first 10,000 miles of driving - a feat you all probably did by the age of fifteen ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ I never drove before other than a very brief stint in California in the 1980â€™s since I lived most of my adult life in New York City where a car is a major liability for most people. In the short time Iâ€™ve been driving Iâ€™ve been hit twice and had a few major near misses ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ I have definitely developed a healthy respect for what you have all been dealing with your whole lives - driving is an expensive and time consuming business where it seems the only certainties are depreciation and accidents and ever increasing costs! ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ I think perhaps I was wiser than I thought to avoid it all these years! I still love cars and love seeing a nice American V8 or German Turbo 6 race by me - but damn I have to say I admire the patience and resilience you all must have to have done this every day for decades and logging up many hundreds of thousands of miles (maybe over a million for some of you) Well now Iâ€™m about to get back behind the wheel to go teach another class ğŸ˜œğŸ˜œ
