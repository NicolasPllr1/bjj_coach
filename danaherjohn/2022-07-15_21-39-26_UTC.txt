Finding your favorite moves: This game is built around the idea of knowing ENOUGH about MANY moves so that you can anticipate and defend them and knowing a LOT about a FEW moves so that you can beat anyone with them. Selecting those few moves is a deep personal journey that will last as long as you stay in the sport. Everyone has their own path. I’ve seen great champions take widely divergent routes to the top. These best advice I can give you is this. Individuality and self expression is great but don’t ignore the fact that certain moves outperform most others. Historically high percentage moves that have worked very well for generations across all skill levels and weight divisions should generally be preferred when assessing which moves will become your major weapons. Within the ranks of those high percentage moves there is sufficient variety to let you express your individuality. You can have a few unorthodox features in your game, that’s fine, but there is a reason why a subset of moves get most of the best results in jiu jitsu - let those moves be your main focus and express your individuality within those to make a great compromise between individual expression and high percentage technique
