Angle, angle and more angle: The single best place to be in combat sports is directly behind your opponent. However, it’s very difficult to get behind someone with skills since they’ve been taught from the first day never to concede their back. So typically you’ll have to work with ANGLE - where you move away from frontal positions and off line to the side - it’s not as dramatic and decisive as the back, buts in most cases it’s more than enough to get good work done or at least create a reaction that’ll enable you to attack successfully. Make a habit of creating angle on opponents - it doesn’t always have to be a huge angular change, often even a small change in angle can create impressive results. As your opponent tries to re-align himself with you there will be a window of opportunity for you to enter. You’ll find that the game becomes a lot easier when you attack from angle rather than straight through the front door
