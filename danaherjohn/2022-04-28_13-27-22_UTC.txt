Two for the price of one: GOOD jiu jitsu players create PROBLEMS for their opponents; but GREAT jiu jitsu players create DILEMMAS for their opponents. Whenever you create situations where you can play two threats simultaneously against an opponent such that the more the opponent tries to avoid one, the more he exposes himself to the other, you have created a winning situation for yourself. One of the very best examples of this comes from the TRIANGLE and this is definitely a great starting point for you to build the concept into your thinking about jiu jitsu. Iâ€™m almost every variation of the triangle you have both a threat of STRANGLE and JOINT LOCK. As you attack the strangle and your opponent defends, you can immediately switch to arm bar ( juji gatame), kimura, straight arm bar (ude gatame) and wrist locks, even an American lock in some cases. The relationship goes both ways; as you attack these joint locks you can overcome resistance by switching back to the strangle. Here, Gordon Ryan switches the emphasis of his triangle attack from strangle to juji gatame arm bar to overcome the initial line of resistance and create a game ending dilemma. This type of thinking must become part of your jiu jitsu consciousness - and the triangle is an excellent place for you to start
