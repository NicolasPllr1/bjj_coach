Anticipating failure: It’s good to be confident with your favorite moves and believe that you can get them to work anytime any place on any athlete - but we’ve got to be realistic too - sometimes your favorite move isn’t going to work, so we got to have effective back ups that enable us to go past an initial failure into success. Certain moves go hand in hand with each other. If you’ve got a favorite it’s important you back it up with appropriate follow ups when that inevitable failure arises. That way you’ll go immediately into a second move (and potentially third or fourth when you’re really getting good (any further than four is an indication that your mechanics are poor and it’s more likely you need to improve your execution than that your opponent has great defense)). So yes - it’s important you anticipate failure. This isn’t being negative, it’s being realistic. Just make sure you’ve got good follow ups that failure will open a door to success
