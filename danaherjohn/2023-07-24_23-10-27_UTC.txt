A very impressive performance! Big Daniel Manasoiu @jiujitsugiant competed at a submission only event in Houston Texas @submissionhunterpro yesterday that featured some very talented black belt competitors. Dan won all three matches by submission to take first place. Interestingly he chose to win via the same move - mounted suffocation/asphyxiation - this is a very difficult submission to pull off against strong opposition. In addition he was able to show excellent sweeps from bottom, takedowns/throws from standing and fine guard passes into pin transitions to get the position required for suffocation. People often think of heavyweight jiu jitsu as slow and awkward, but I teach the same moves to heavyweights as lights and with the same expectations for precision - the results really surprise people when they see a heavyweight moving light a much lighter athlete. Congratulations Dan!! That was a very impressive performance!
