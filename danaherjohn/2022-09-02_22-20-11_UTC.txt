ADCC 2022: Counting down the training days for the biggest event in grappling. Teams from around the world are making their final preparations for the big show. Looking at the athlete roster for this year I must say I have never seen anything close to the level of talent in any previous ADCC event. In the old days of ADCC the first round were usually mismatches that enabled the favorite to advance with minimal stress. In this event even the lowest seed athletes are outright killers who could easily upset even established champions. I am certain this year will see some of these unknown athletes emerge as new legends. I am thrilled at the growth of this sport - this event is going to show that growth in two ways - the audience and the athletes. Looking forward to seeing you there!
