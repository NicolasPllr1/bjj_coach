Dual threats: We always talk about position and submission as though it is either/or; but in truth at the higher levels it’s the simultaneous threat of both together that usually creates the breakthrough you seek. When you’re behind an opponent and want to secure scoring position - threaten the strangle - your opponent will become forgetful of defending the rear mount when he’s battling for his life against submission and you’ll likely score. When you can get the strangle set in place - threaten the position - make him fight against the placement of your hooks, he’ll become forgetful of the strangle danger as he becomes preoccupied with defending rear mount, and that’s when you’ll sink the strangle. Two threats - attack with one will make any opponent forgetful of the other - and that’s when you’ll get your goal
