Offensive asymmetry is the goal: One of the fundamental goals of Jiu jitsu is to create offensive asymmetry, that is, to put yourself in positions where you can attack your opponent much more readily and in more powerful fashion than he can attack you. So for example, in a self defense fighting situation getting mounted on an adversary will allow you to strike with fists and elbows much more effectively than an opponent underneath you can strike back. In a grappling situation the rear mount/back creates the greatest asymmetry. Once you get behind someone all your submission attacks become significantly easier whilst an opponent is left with only a few low percentage offensive options and is essentially one hundred percent defensive while you are one hundred percent offensive - this should always be your goal
