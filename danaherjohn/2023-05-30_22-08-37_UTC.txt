Decisions are easier when you work with priorities: Jiu jitsu gives you a thousand possibilities to work with every second. With so many choices available and so little time to make a decision is can be difficult to know which options to commit to. Make it easier for yourself. Make your decisions BEFORE the action. Lay down a set of outcomes in order of desirability and let that ordered list be your decision maker. For me - I have a simple motto that guides the vast majority of decision making in Jiu jitsu - NOTHING BEATS THE BACK - in any situation where I’m presented by multiple competing options this simple rule makes the decision for me. Then it’s just a matter of creating a short list of other options arranged in order of desirability to create second, third, fourth and fifth and you’ll immediately have a sense of direction and decisiveness in every jiu jitsu situation
