I am very pleased to announce the release of my latest instructional video with @bjj.fanatics Thos is the third and final instructional in the STANDING2GROUND series which features jiu jitsu standing position and takedown skills. This third volume covers UPPER BODY TAKEDOWNS which featured so prominently in the award winning performances of my students in the ADCC 2022 World Championships. Upper body takedowns have several notable advantages in Jiu Jitsu competition - they largely avoid the danger of upper body submissions as you attempt takedowns and offer much better probability of scoring after the takedown due to tight upper body connection in the critical aftermath of a takedown attempt. My students made upper body takedowns the basis of their standing game and had great success with it - perhaps you can too!! Link in my Instagram bio
