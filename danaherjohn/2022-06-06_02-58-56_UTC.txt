Victory in LA!! Nicholas Meregali was able to fulfill his dream of winning the IBJJF Open Weight division today in Long Beach, California. It was a remarkable weekend for the Brazilian jiu jitsu star. He won every match until the finals by submission with his scintillating display. He did all this while suffering from a severe rib injury that occurred thirteen days before the tournament and which got progressively worse with every match as the weekend unfolded. Mr Meregali showed real courage and mental fortitude to take the final in a gritty and hard fought match and take gold. It was a real lesson in the degree to watch inner resolve will always play a powerful role in the outcome of championship matches - mechanics and tactics are responsible for most victories- but the most memorable ones are often those that have more human elements at their core - Mr Meregali showed that this weekend.  It was a fantastic event overall with so many great athletes present and many outstanding matches - I hope you all enjoyed the show!
