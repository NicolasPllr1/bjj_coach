When the workouts done: Back home in Austin and in the gym getting athletes ready for upcoming grappling shows. I love the feeling of returning from a show and going straight from the airport back to the gym - that feeling of hitting the ground running is a good one. Gordon Ryan is getting ready for a very tough match against the very talented Pedro Merinho @pedromarinhojj who has had a stellar last twelve months in grappling. They will meet at WNO here in Austin Texas on @flograppling  Now the workouts over but an empty dojo is a fine place to figure out the plan for tomorrow when the dojo is full once againâ€¦
