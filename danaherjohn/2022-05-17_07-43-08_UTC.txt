Watching the mighty Thais in training: I landed at midnight in Singapore last night - today it was workout time with Garry Tonon who will be matched against the brilliant submission specialist Tye Ruotolo this Friday night in a ten minute grappling bout as part of the @onechampionship mixed MMA/Grappling event! Mr Ruotolo and his twin brother Kade have been in incredible form this last year - both racking up impressive victories over the best in the sport with their lightning fast entries into submissions, exhausting pace and excellent integration of ground and standing technique - this will be without question one of Mr Tonon’s toughest matches. When in Singapore I love to train at @evolvemma in Far East Square. It’s always an incredible experience to walk in and see some of the very best Muay Thai athletes doing their daily workouts. The level of Muay Thai here is incredible. They have a level of finesse and efficiency in every aspect of their movement that is truly a sight to behold and a true inspiration to all of the other combat sports. Today I had the privilege of watching the great Nong-O go through his workout. His workout sets a standard of excellence that every martial artist should strive for regardless of their discipline. When it comes to watching sports outside my own I really don’t care WHAT i watch - SO LONG AS ITS THE BEST IN THE WORLD DOING IT - because the best always have a way of doing things that illuminate and inspire  you in whatever you do yourself. It’s fascinating to watch the way the elite Thais move between extreme focus and precision one moment and yet shift into relaxed joviality the next, then right back to work. Thank you to @evolvemma gym for the being such a great place to get ready for the toughest challenges
