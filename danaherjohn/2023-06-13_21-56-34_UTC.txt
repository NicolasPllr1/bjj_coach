Extension: Almost all of Jiu jitsu is performed in a compact stance. A big part of being defensively responsible in the sport is maintaining that compact stance. Accordingly, when you can get an opponent extended - itâ€™s usually a good thing as it represents the opposite of what we normally see as good stance. Look to stretch your opponents knees away from his elbows whenever you can. He wants to be compact - you want him extended. Who consistently wins this simple preliminary battle often goes on to win the contest.
