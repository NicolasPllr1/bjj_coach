Speed: Speed is a wonderful attribute in most combat sports but in a predominantly ground grappling sport like jiu jitsu speed becomes a little more nuanced  for the simple reason that you usually canâ€™t really move very quickly on the floor. Rather than try to make yourself faster - take a different approach - instead of trying to make yourself faster focus on making your opponent slower. Remember - there are always TWO ways to win a race. You can make yourself faster or you can make the other guy slower. In truth, it is the second option that is generally preferable in Jiu jitsu. Speed is largely determined by genetics  and decreases with age. Slowing someone down through grip and positioning is determined by skill and is the way of longevity. There are some scenarios in Jiu jitsu where speed is an important asset - many takedowns in standing position, toreando passing are good examples. However, if you have close body contact with an opponent on the floor, the ability to slow the other fellow down will typically prove more important than the ability to speed yourself up
