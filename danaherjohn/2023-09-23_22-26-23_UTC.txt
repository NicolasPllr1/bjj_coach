Direction of force: When it comes time to apply breaking pressure on a good one of the most important factors is DIRECTION OF FORCE. It easy to focus primarily on GENERATION of force ie trying to generate as much force as possible. That’s good, but lots of force applied in the wrong directions won’t do much good. Focus more on the most efficient DIRECTION to apply whatever force you can generate - that’s what usually gets the most decisive results.
