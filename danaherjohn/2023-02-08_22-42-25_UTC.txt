Most of the good things in jiu jitsu occur when you misalign yourself with your opponent: It’s difficult to get most of the moves in Jiu Jitsu when you’re directly underneath them and lined up with their centerline. Everything gets easier when you shift out to the side a little and get on your side rather than flat on your back. These movements are small and easy to ignore when watching, but they have great significance in improving your performance. In addition this kind of shifting off center is what enables you to enter into moves without flexibility or dexterity and thus are the best hope for less athletic or older practitioners to enter into moves. Next time your feeling stuck start with a shift out to the side and THEN enter your move - you’ll be surprised how small changes can garner big results
