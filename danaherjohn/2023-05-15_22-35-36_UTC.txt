Movement creates opportunity: The hardest times to apply submissions are on a static opponent who’s limbs are thoroughly contracted. Movement almost always provokes an opponent into extension of the limbs and an extended opponent is much easier to submit. Keep your opponent moving - if this proves difficult - move around your opponent - both will provoke an opponent into reaching and extending his limbs - and if you’ve been practicing your submissions diligently - that’s all you need to attack!
