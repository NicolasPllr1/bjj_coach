The one thing a coach can never give you: A coach can help your technique and your tactics. As you improve in these areas, your confidence will organically grow. A coach can build a room that gives you the training partners and infrastructure to sustain growth over time. A coach can give you a philosophy or vision of jiu jitsu that colors your view of the game and gives you a sense of direction. But one thing no coach can ever do for you is to give you PASSION. That must come from you and you alone. If you lack it, no amount of coaching will help, the encouragement of friends will be of no avail and you will never endure the numerous hardships, disappointments and boredom of a long term training routine. What sparks passion? No one knows - but one thing we all know is when we have it and when we donâ€™t. Everyone always asks what a coach can bring to you - but never forget the one thing you must bring to the coach - without it nothing will happen.
