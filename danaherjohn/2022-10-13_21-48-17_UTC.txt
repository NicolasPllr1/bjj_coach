Emotion: This game is about decision making and calculating risk and reward. Emotion doesn’t help decision making and calculation. I find most people do their best work in a calm and emotionless state. It’s sometimes difficult to achieve this in the pressure of competition but you don’t have to be perfect - just better than the other fellow. The time for emotion is after the performance - then you can let out whatever you were holding back!
