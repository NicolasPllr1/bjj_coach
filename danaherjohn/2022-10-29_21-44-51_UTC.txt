Jiu jitsu with Mr Tom Hardy: The team had a blast training the last two days with the great English actor Tom Hardy, who is also a talented jiu jitsu player!! Mr Hardy is here with some of his British  friends. Mr Hardy does truly great work helping the welfare of former soldiers coming back from war into civilian life through the @reorgcharity foundation. Jiu jitsu is often useful as a means of getting soldiers back together in a healthy environment that builds the old camaraderie they had in a civilian setting and can help smooth the transition back home. I’ve always been a fan of Mr Hardy’s cinematic work after Georges St Pierre, who was obsessed with The Batman movie in which the Caped Crusader takes on arch villain Bane (played by Mr Hardy), used to quote endlessly from the movie during fight camps! When I was demonstrating technique with him I kept expecting him to say “do you feel in charge?” - as he grabbed me by the neck! 😂😂 He is a very kind man and a really great representative of jiu jitsu
