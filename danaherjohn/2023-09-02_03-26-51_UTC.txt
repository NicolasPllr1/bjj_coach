Victory in Las Vegas! Nicholas Meregali performed one of the most impressive feats I have seen in Grappling tonight in Las Vegas. Two weeks ago he defeated the great double ADCC champion Kaynan Duarte - the man most people believe is the greatest no gi grappler on the plant outside of Gordon Ryan. Tonight he defeated the man most people believe is the best active gi grappler on the planet Victor Hugo. To defeat two such great champions in two weeks in two very different grappling styles is truly impressive. Both Mr Meregali and Mr Hugo showed they were a level above the rest of the field by quickly submitting both their first two world class opponents. The final was a tense tactical affair with Mr Meregali winning via sweep and subsequent top control - very impressive indeed especially given that he was considerably outweighed by his rival. What an amazing performance by this great athlete. In an age of specialists he is showing itâ€™s still possible to beat the best back to back gi and no gi!
