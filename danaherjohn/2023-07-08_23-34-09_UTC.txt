On the road again: Flying out to Bangkok, Thailand for Garry Tonon’s upcoming MMA bout for @onechampionship against the very tough Russian Shamil Gasanov. Mr Gasanov is an excellent wrestler and grappler and combines this well with robust striking - he is undefeated in MMA and defeated one of the highest ranked athletes in OneChampionship in his debut! He is an excellent exponent of the Sambo/wrestling/kickboxing synthesis that has proven so effective for Caucasus Russian fighters. It’s a long flight! But growing up in New Zealand gets one used to that! Looking forward to getting back to Thailand - there is a martial arts spirit and pedigree there that is unrivaled. Trading in the dry heat of Texas for the humidity of South East Asia! I’m looking forward to it
