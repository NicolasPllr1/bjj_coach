Adjustments: In the chaos of a match it’s actually quite rare that your first positioning for a given move will be correct. Too many athletes get to a given attacking position and immediately attempt to complete it when their positioning is not optimal. The result usually isn’t good. When you understand that the first entry into the move gets you in the door but doesn’t represent exactly where you want to be, you’ll take that extra time to make your adjustments and work patiently into better leverage position. It may take a little longer, but the result will be a big increase in effectiveness. Don’t just enter - enter and adjust - understand that your first attempt usually isn’t optimal and that just a few small movements can convert it from something that almost works to something that definitely works!
