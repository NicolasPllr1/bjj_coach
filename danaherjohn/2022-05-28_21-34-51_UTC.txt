Dual threats: When your Dad first showed you how to throw a punch he told you jab was good, rear cross was good, but the combination of them both - the old 1-2, was best of all. Your Dad was absolutely correct. The very same advice applies just as well to jiu jitsu. Creating one threat is good, but creating a dual threat is always better. Here I use the leg position of a triangle combined with the arm position of kimura to create a dual threat. The more an opponent defends one the more vulnerable he becomes to the other. As you gave better and better opponents, the finishes won’t come easy, and the more you will have to create dual threats to get the breakthrough you seek. Learn to match and pair your moves - they won’t be twice as effective as a single move - they’ll be FOUR times as effective due to their action/reaction dynamic that is so difficult for an opponent to counter. You already know your favorite moves - now it’s time to form them into your favorite PAIRS in order to get to the next level.
