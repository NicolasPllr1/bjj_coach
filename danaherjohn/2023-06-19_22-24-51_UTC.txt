Awareness: When we think of awareness in Jiu jitsu we usually think of awareness of our defensive responsibilities and our attacking opportunities. These certainly are the most important types of awareness in the sport. There is another type of awareness however, that never gets discussed. This is MAT AWARENESS. This is the awareness of where you are positioned on a crowded mat. It is this type of awareness that makes you a safe training partner on a crowded mat. It’s easy to get so focused on your opponents that you lose track of where you are and start crashing into other people or accidentally kicking or elbowing them. When you have a room full of people who have food mat awareness everything runs smoothly. When you have a room full of people with no mat awareness it’s a disaster. Not only does mat awareness have value for safety, it also has a deeper self defense value. In a real fight you must be cognizant of your immediate surroundings and people or objects around you, because they can play a crucial role in what happens. Avoiding tunnel vision and having a good sense of what’s going on around you is an essential self defense skill that you can practice every day on the mat by making yourself conscious of the people and movements around you as you grapple. Train yourself to be able to follow conversations of the people on the sideline, what positions the people next to you are in, where you can expect them to be ten seconds from now based on their current movements. This kind of mental training will make you safer on the mat AND on the street
