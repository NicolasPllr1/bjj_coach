Making waves: The talented juniors of New Wave had another great night of local competition tonight here in Austin. @reeseis_bjj Reese LeFever won the lightweight tournament against very talented opponents and won every match by submission in a superb performance that showed his hard work in training has has great effects. @davis_asare continued his incredible weekend of work - he competed three nights in a row in three different events and won every match mostly with highlight reel submissions! It’s great to see the combination of ambition and hard work working its magic! As always keep your eyes on the distant horizon but your mind on the next practical step and you’ll be amazed at what you can accomplish!!
