Good jiu jitsu players create PROBLEMS for their opponents; GREAT jiu jitsu players create DILEMMAS: Every problem has a solution. Dilemmas are different. They don’t have a solution, only two bad outcomes that force you to choose the least damaging one. Observe this photo of Gordon Ryan passing half guard - it’s an excellent example of a simple but powerful expression of creating dilemmas from which there is no good outcome for your opponent. He has freed the knee of his his left leg. This enables him to drive his knee across his opponents far hip towards a mounted position (it won’t yet be a true mount because his foot is still trapped, but it’s getting close). His opponent recognizes the danger and reaches to stop the knee with his hand. This is what Mr Ryan is looking for. By reaching for the knee the opponent has created a big opening for a far side underhook that will enable Mr Ryan to go into several very strong passing positions; If he DOESN’T reach for the knee, Mr Ryan will simply drive the knee across the hip towards the mounted position and take even stronger passing positions - either way it’s bad for the opponent. This is the kind of game you want to play whenever possible in jiu jitsu. You can’t always do it - but you’ll be pleasantly surprised how often you can if you teach yourself to look for it. Why settle for creating a problem that talented opponents will find a solution for when instead you can create a dilemma for which there is no solution?
