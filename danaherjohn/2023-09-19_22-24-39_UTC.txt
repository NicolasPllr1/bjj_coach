Work your way to a position rather than jump to a position: Superior position is always one of the major goals of the sport. As such many people don’t care too much how they get there so long as they get to the goal - but HOW you get there is important for your long term development. You want to WORK your way to a position - systematically working from grip to grip, hold to hold - your opponent under tight control throughout the movement. That’s not to say that you can’t have success jumping from one position to another - you definitely can - but it’s difficult to do this reliably and consistently as opponents will feel the space and lightness as you transition from one position to another and escape/counter in the transition. Long term it’s better to exert as much control in the transition as possible - that way you’ll be successful for a long time even when opponents know what you’re trying to do
