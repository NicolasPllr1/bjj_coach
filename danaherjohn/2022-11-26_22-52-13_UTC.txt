Stopping movement facilitates submission: When you get into a submission hold the opponent will usually go into some rather extreme defensive movements. It’s not unusual to find yourself twisting and turning wildly as you try to follow his defensive movements. Learning to use the IMMOBILIZATION potential of submission holds first and the BREAKING/STRANGLING second helps a lot in the application of submission holds against tough opponents. Take the extra time to focus first on stopping movement and then when you’ve achieved that - THEN show your breaking/strangulation prowess. It’s quite difficult to impose breaking mechanics on a moving opponent - stifling movement first makes the task a lot easier!
