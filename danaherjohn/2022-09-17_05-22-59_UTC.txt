Legends: Its great to be around the excitement of ADCC this weekend! I am thrilled to see that two of the most important people in jiu jitsu career are going to be rewarded with induction into the ADCC Hall of Fame - my teacher Renzo Gracie  and my great friend and mentor Roger Gracie. Both were great champions and both are great coaches who were pivotal figures in the growth of our sport and also in my own development. I am eternally grateful for their guidance. Itâ€™s also great to my friend from that same era, Kyra Gracie, one of the most polished athletes I ever saw get her induction to the hall of fame alongside her family members! It was great seeing all three today here in Las Vegas!
