Against good opponents the first move rarely scores - you will be judged primarily by the quality of your second, third or fourth attack that actually gets the breakthrough. Having said that, don’t get lazy with those initial attacks. If they are not performed with real commitment, or at the very least the appearance of real commitment, they won’t provoke the responses that make the second, third or fourth attack succeed. So even if you expect them to fail and are using then only as a set up to a later attack - go in with commitment. Only then will the opponent respond in ways that make the later real attack succeed
