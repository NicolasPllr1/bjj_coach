Advantage: A central theme of Jiu jitsu is this - WHENEVER ENGAGED WITH THE OPPONENT ALWAYS TRY TO GAIN SOME FORM OF PRIOR ADVANTAGE BEFORE LAUNCHING YOUR MAIN ATTACK. The first form of advantage most Jiu Jitsu students learn is POSITIONAL advantage and certainly this is one of the mo important forms of advantage in the sport, but it is far from the only one. Learn to exploit every Avenue of advantage - balance, grip, postural, tactical the list is long. Here, Nicholas Meregali has an opponent hopping on one leg while he is on two, if he can add a balance advantage and a postural advantage the takedown will be inevitable, if not, at least he has gained tactical advantage. Donâ€™t just attack - get advantage prior to attack - this is the spirit of Jiu jitsu
