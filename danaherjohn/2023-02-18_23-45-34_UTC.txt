The fight for position: “position before submission” is the great cliche of Jiu jitsu. Like most cliches it is an over simplification but with a lot of truth to it. There are two great positional battles in Jiu jitsu. The first is the battle to get past the legs into chest to chest positions. The second is to get past the elbows to chest to back positions. There are others, but those are the two most important. If you can win those two battle consistently, you’ll win a lot of matches - this I can promise you. Look at your opponents elbows for what they are - an obstacle to be flanked. Make that a habit and you’ll make winning a habit!
