I had a fun time working some jiu jitsu with Maynard James Keenan @iamthebriefcase from the rock band Tool, who has been doing jiu jitsu for a very long time and has an excellent technical grasp of the sport. It was a lot of fun going over triangle entries and finishes. He impressed everyone with his ability! He also has a a great personal history in Jiu jitsu - studying with Rickson and his students in the early days in California - traveling long distances to train long before he gained fame in the music world and still finding time to train as a rock star on the road. He also gave us some fascinating insights into the world of rock music and super stardom - those guys have a lifestyle that very few can handle! Our lives are very simple and easy by comparison!! I was struck by the similarities on a much smaller scale of stage presence and performance between rock music and jiu jitsu as Mr Keenan told his tales. Learning to get comfortable and perform consistently on stage is a struggle for developing athletes but rock musicians have to deal with this on a MUCH bigger scale and under tremendous pressure. What a pleasure to meet such an interesting fellow under the umbrella of Jiu jitsu. After the training session he went on the do the Joe Rogan @joeroganexperience @joerogan podcast - I canâ€™t wait to see that to get more insight from this fascinating fellow!
