Negate first, attack second: Nothing is riskier than attacking an opponent who is simultaneously attacking you. If you have a big skill advantage this can work, but if you are well matched the result can go either way. A safer strategy is to begin by NEGATING YOUR OPPONENTS OFFENSE. Usually this is done by a combination of stance, positioning and grip. If you can first shut down an opponents ability to attack, then once this is achieved you can focus on your own offense with little distraction. Think about daily life - when you go to perform any given task you’ll find it much more difficult if you’re being distracted and interrupted by someone as you try to perform than if you have no distractions. The same is true in Jiu jitsu. Try shutting down your opponents ability to grip you or get into threatening positions first and THEN enter into your attacks - it’s much easier when you can focus on what you’re doing rather than worry about what the other guy is doing
