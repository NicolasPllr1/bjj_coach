Precision: The more precise you are with your mechanics the more effective your moves will be when applied with whatever strength you have. However, we have to be realistic. The more stress and chaos we are subject to in sparring and competition the harder it will be to maintain the ideal of perfect mechanics. Don’t despair. You don’t have to be perfect in application - just good enough to get the job done. Your goal in drilling is to get as close to perfection as you can. Your goal in sparring is to be good enough to get the result you seek. The more precise you are in drilling, the more there will be a carryover effect into your sparring that increases your precision; but be realistic, it’ll never be a perfect, pretty and refined as drilling so don’t be upset if your game feels a little messy and klutzy compared with your drills.
