Victory in Thailand! Garry Tonon showed his developing MMA grappling mastery with a beautiful kimura/sumi gaeshi takedown into submission in less than two minutes against tough and experienced Johnny Nunoz in Thailand in the @onechampionship event. Good Grappling is always exciting - but even more so in the context of MMA. Mr Tonon showed the brilliance he is renown for with a beautiful improvised takedown and use of the cage to get the position required for the finish. Congratulations Mr Tonon - flawless victory!! ðŸ˜œðŸ˜œ
