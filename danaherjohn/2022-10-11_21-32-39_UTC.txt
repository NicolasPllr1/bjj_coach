Trouble: In Jiu jitsu we always train ourselves to find the best routes to the best outcomes. The reality is however, that your opponents are doing the same thing and many of those opponents are very talented. As such, it’s always prudent to prepare yourself for trouble, including the worst kinds of trouble. Getting out of fully locked in joint locks is probably the scariest situation in Jiu jitsu because the price of failure in a competitive match can be a broken limb. Getting the confidence to escape from these scenarios has to begin in the gym. As always, start with lowered pressure so that you can build over time to escape from increasingly tight holds. Make sure your partner understands the difference between extension of a limb and HYPER extension, so that they can create a tension that gives realism but no damage if you don’t perform the escape moves quite correctly. Learning to keep a calm mind during a crises is half the battle of extricating yourself. Fear doesn’t make your escapes better - only skill does that
